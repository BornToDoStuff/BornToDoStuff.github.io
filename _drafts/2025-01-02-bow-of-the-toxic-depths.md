This bow has an emerald sheen to it, and its strung with a blood red sinew. If you touch this bowstring without gloves or some form of protection you take 1 Acid damage each time you do so. This weapon has 12 charges and regains 3d4 expended charges each day at dawn.  
When you make an attack with this bow you can expend a number of charges, and when you do the arrow is dissolved mid-flight as it is consumed by a bolt of acid. On a hit the target takes 2d10 acid damage. Hit or miss, the bolt then explodes in a shower of bile. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage for each charge expended. Any attack made when you expend charges is not affected by water or being underwater, unlike regular bow attacks.
