This vial contains a single large fragment of gray brain tissue, carefully preserved. When consumed you feel a rush of power, and a sense of helplessness, as you are forced to bear witness to the massive scale of the cosmos. For the next minute you are Paralyzed as you are overwhelmed with visions and knowledge.    
After this mind-bending moment you gain proficiency with any combination of up to 6 skills, tools, or languages. If you have the Spellcasting feature you can choose to replace any number of these proficiencies with spells instead.

<!--excerpt-->  
<div class="curse">**Curse.** For each item you chose to learn or gain proficiency in you lose a valuable memory, of the DM’s choice. This can not be reversed except by a <magic-spell>Wish</magic-spell> spell or deity. Additionally, there is the shadowy creature that lurks in your dreams from this night onward.
