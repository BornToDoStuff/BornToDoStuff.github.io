This scimitar is made from a single massive pincer. Its jagged edges almost tear more than slice, and the wounds it leaves are not for faint of heart.  
This weapon does an additional 1d8 Acid damage on a successful hit. Additionally, on a critical hit the target creature screams out in pain and until the end of their next turn has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. If the creature was concentrating on a spell they automatically fail the Constitution saving throw to maintain their concentration.
