### ToDo:
* Make contextual "Return to Top" button
* Make mobile menu less intrusive
* make tags pages more managable by hiding tags on # visit (makes it look like tags each have their own special page but its just the main page)
* show only top 20 tags, forward "show more tags" to word cloud that links back to main page and shows whatever tag was clicked on
* figure out Algolia search (could possibly make tag pages unnecessary with its amazing search features)
