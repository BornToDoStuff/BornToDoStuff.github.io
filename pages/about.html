<h1>About</h1>
<br />

<h3>Who made these items?</h3>
<p>This collection of items are all by me, BornToDoStuff, and is not an amalgamation of other people's works. There are some items that have been featured in other works though!</p>

<h3>Can I use these for my own games?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! You are free to use any item you enjoy for your own personal games or educational purposes.</p>

<h3>Who made the art?</h3>
<p>The art was not made by me, but I do have rights to use it. All of the art on the site has been created by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oddgobgrasso.bsky.social">Oddgob Games (formerly Direquest)</a>, you should check them out!</p>
<p>It is not licensed for general use, but some of it may be available at Direquest's discretion.</p>

<h3>What are those diamond shapes on each item?</h3>
<p>Those are just another way of seeing rarity and attunement for each item in addition to the subtitle. They are hidden on mobile to save screen space.</p>

<h3>Can I filter my searches even farther?</h3>
<p>Actually yes. There is some filtering if you click "filter results" underneath the menu after searching.</p>
<p>However, if you mean even more than that, I have enabled advanced searching. You can find documentation on advanced searching <a href="https://lunrjs.com/guides/searching.html">here</a>, which can allow you to search specific fields, avoid terms, and more. The fields available to search in the index are <code>title</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>subtypes</code>, <code>classes</code>, <code>damage</code>, <code>school</code>, <code>tags</code>, and <code>searchtext</code>. This will allow you to for instance search for all the items that are both for wizard and in the school of transmutation; Like this <code>+school:transmutation +classes:wizard</code>.</p>
<p>I am trying to keep the search from being overwhelming to the average user but I understand wanting to have a lot of search control so I hope these tools help.</p>

<h3>Do you do item commissions?</h3>
<p>I sure do. If you are interested in paying for a custom item comission or asking about commercial use of my items you can reach me at <span id="emailHolder"><a title="show my email address" href="#showEmail" onclick="d = 'gmail.com'; u = 'borntodostuff'; document.getElementById('emailHolder').innerHTML = u + '@' + d; return false;">my email address</a></span>.</p>

<h3>Where else can I find you?</h3>
<p>I occasionally put things on my <a href="https://twitter.com/BornToDoStuff">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/borntodostuff/">Instagram</a> but its mostly private publications and this site these days.</p>
