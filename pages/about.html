<h1>About</h1>
<br />

<h3>Who made these items?</h3>
This collection of items are all by me, BornToDoStuff, and is not an amalgamation of other people's works.
There are a handful of items where I was assisted or took inspiration from others and I have made a note of this on each item it applies to, giving credit to the person or article that helped me.

<h3>Can I use these for my own games?</h3>
Absolutely! You are free to use any item you enjoy for your own personal games or educational purposes.

<h3>What are those diamond shapes on each item?</h3>
Those are just another way of seeing rarity and attunement for each item separate from the subtitle text. When you are on mobile they are hidden to save screen space.

<h3>Can I filter my searches even farther?</h3>
Actually yes. There is some filtering when you search if you click "filter results" underneath the menu after searching. However if you mean even more than that, I have enabled advanced searching, which you can find documentation on <a href="https://lunrjs.com/guides/searching.html">here</a>, and you can use that to search individual fields, remove terms, and more. The fields available to search in the index are "title", "type", "subtypes", "classes", "damage", "school", "tags", and "searchtext". This will allow you to for instance search for all the items that are both for wizard and in the school of transmutation; Like so "+school:transmutation +wizard".
I am trying to keep the search from being overwhelming to the average user but I understand wanting to have a lot of search control so I hope these tools help.

<h3>Do you do item commissions?</h3>
I sure do. If you are interested in paying for a custom item comission or asking about commercial use of any of my items you can reach me at <span id="emailHolder"><a title="show my email address" href="#showEmail" onclick="d = 'gmail.com'; u = 'borntodostuff'; document.getElementById('emailHolder').innerHTML = u + '@' + d; return false;">my email address</a></span>.
