This straight blade is crafted from a black alloy that gleams red in the light. It is clearly segmented and a spike juts from the back of each segment.

### Unnatural Speed
The blade seems to cut through the air and it swings with an uncanny speed. At the start of your turn you can prepare yourself to make a flurry of attacks. Until the end of your turn you take a -5 penalty to all your attack rolls, but in return you can make an additional Attack Action as a bonus action.

### Blade Segments
There are sections yet missing from this blade. If you find the missing segments you can place them near the end of the machete and they fly toward it and snap into place. Each segment returned increases the power of this weapon as it increases in length just slightly.

**1 Segment: Graver Bolster.** You can unsheath this weapon almost faster than the eye can follow. If this weapon is within your reach once per turn you can unsheath it without expending your object interaction. Additionally, when you activate Unnatural Speed you can automatically deal 1 slashing damage to a number of creatures up to your dexterity modifier within 5 feet of you.

**2 Segments: Spectral Spine.** As an action you can swing this weapon forward flinging several spectral images of itself through the air as they split off from the sword. Make a ranged attack roll against up to 3 targets within a 30 foot cone, dealing 1d6 piercing damage on a hit. They may appear spectral but their effects are not.

**3 Segments: Scumbag Tip.** As the length of the blade grows it cuts even deeper, but something seems different now. This weapon now scores a critical hit with a roll of 19 or 20 on an attack roll. Additionally, on a critical hit it deals an additional 1d6 poison damage.

**4 Segments: Ghost of the Blade.** As the final segment snaps into place ethereal wisps begin gently curling from the blade. Once per long rest as an action you can summon the ghost of the blade and an angular shadowy figure dashes forward in a 5 foot wide 30 foot line. It makes a melee attack using your modifiers against every creature it passes within 5 feet of. On a successful hit it deals damage as if it was striking with this weapon. Additionally, if it passes through a creature they must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 force damage on a failure.

You will know when you can use this feature again as the ethereal wisps begin anew.

Notes: For increased power the machete can be found with extra segments already on it. Of course this increases the rarity of the item. At your discretion you can easily discard the Blade Segments feature.
