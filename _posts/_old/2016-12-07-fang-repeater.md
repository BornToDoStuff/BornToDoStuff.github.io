As best can be described this appears to you to be a hand crossbow, constructed of bone. The skull of a small creature adorns the business end, and the bolts fire from its mouth. The creature's ribs are splayed down the length of the stock and around a revolving cluster of bone with several bolts within its holes.

This crossbow has a range of 30/60, and when you fire it rapidly spits out 3 bolts in rapid succession as a single attack. On a successful hit you deal 2d4 piercing damage.
If you have already moved this turn you have disadvantage on all attacks with this weapon.

**Hollowed Chamber.** This crossbow does not have the loading property, but instead has the reload(9) property, meaning that you can fire 9 bolts before having to reload as an action.

### Bone Fragments.
There are ribs missing from the spine of the repeater. If you find the missing ribs and re-fasten them the power of the repeater will increase. You will know when you found the right bones because the eye sockets of the skull on the crossbow gently glow red when you grow near a piece.

### 1 Rib: Speed Clip
You can now reload 6 bolts as a bonus action, instead of reloading all 9 as an action.

### 2 Ribs: Reinforced Piston
The bolts fly from the mouth of the skull faster than before. On a successful hit you now deal an additional 1d4 piercing damage.

### 3 Ribs: Double Clip
The ribs bend outward as the central bone cluster expands. The repeater can hold 6 more bolts than before and now has the reload(15) property instead of the reload(9) property.

### 4 Ribs: Tracking Critters
The eye sockets of the repeater now constantly glow red. Once per short rest as an action you can empty the remainder of the bolts in the repeater. The bolts wind through the air as they seek their targets. For every 3 bolts remaining you may target an additional creature within a 60 foot cone and make a single attack roll with advantage against each creature.

Notes: For increased power the revolver can be found with extra ribs already in it. Of course this increases the rarity of the item. At your discretion you can easily discard the Bone Fragments feature.
