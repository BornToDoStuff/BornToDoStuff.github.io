This longbow is appears to be made from horn wrapped with sinew, and dyed a deep red. Unlike most bows you must use your Strength modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls with this weapon.

**Signature Caelondian Weapon.** If you are attuned with this bow as an action you can call on the spirits of the Caelondia Breakers as you pull back the string. Strands of light manifest at the tip of the arrow and swirl down the shaft towards your hand and the bow resounds with a crack when you release. The arrow fires forward in flash of light 1 foot wide and 50 feet long before disintegrating. Make a separate attack roll for each target in the line. The arrow deals 1d8 + your Strength modifier radiant damage to the first target hit and half that much damage to each additional target hit.
