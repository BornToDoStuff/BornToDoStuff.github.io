This hammer has a massive square head made from a gold alloy and is well worn on its spiked front face. On each side of the head near the front there is a small hole that seems to be made to hold a prism or gemstone. The handle is forged from a blue steel and tightly wrapped in cloth. The hammer as a whole weighs 8 pounds and has the property heavy, although almost all of the weight is from its large head.

### Checkered Face
Attacks made with this hammer ignore resistance to bludgeoning damage and grant you advantage on attack rolls against stone objects.

### Stunning Wallop 
If you have not moved yet this turn as an action you can bring the hammer down over your head with inhuman force, the hammer seeming to pull itself towards the ground. Make an attack roll against a target within 5 feet. Hit or miss, each creature other than you within 5 feet of the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 thunder damage. When you use the hammer in this way your movement speed is reduced to 0 until the beginning of your next turn.

### Returned Shards
If you can manage to find the missing pieces of the Cael Hammer its power will increase with each shard returned. These shards appear to be small cubes of gold and are placed point first into the holes of the Cael Hammer. They settle into place with a click, and are almost impossible to remove.

**1 Shard: Reverse Grip.** You can swing at least as hard coming back as going forward. If you successfully hit a creature twice in one turn with this hammer they are knocked back up to 10 feet.

**2 Shards: Alloy Shaft.** The hammer feels like it guides itself towards your targets. On a successful hit you deal an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage.

**3 Shards: Bell Face.** Your blows resound as they strike their target, dazing them. Once per long rest you can activate the hammer as an action. For the next minute any creature hit by the hammer must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the beginning of your next turn.

**4 Shards: Ura Engravings.** As the last shard snaps into place the hammer glows slightly as delicate lines trace over the hammer etching tribal symbols into its surface. This hammer now scores a critical hit on a 19 or 20. Additionally, on a critical hit you deal an extra 2d8 damage (for a total of 5d8 bludgeoning damage).

**Notes:** At your discretion you can easily discard the Returned Shards feature for a more standard item.
