This light oaken staff is stripped of its bark and has gentle grooves winding up and around it. While you are attuned to this staff you can attune to up to three Ioun stones without using attunement slots. Additionally, while attuned to this staff when you toss an Ioun stone into the air the stone orbits the staff at a distance of 3-12 inches, instead of your head.

If you make a successful attack or grab check against an Ioun stone using this staff its attunement is immediately broken and it falls to the ground.

As an action you can force another creature’s Ioun stone that you can see to move towards you. Make an Intelligence(Arcana) check, DC 18. On a success the stone begins moving towards you at a rate of 10 feet per turn as long as you are within sight of it.
