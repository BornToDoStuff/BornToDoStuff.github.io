A small tattoo resembling a birthmark is carefully inked on a baby or child and an adult. The child takes on a familial resemblance to the adult as it grows and is generally accepted by observers as the progeny of the adult. After one year the strength of the bond deepens and requires significant magic/divine intervention to reveal or remove.
if the child finds out about the mark (verbally, by themselves, through magic, or otherwise), after the period it takes to disappear, over the next year the effects of the bond wear off and they shed all familial resemblance to the fake parent. Additionally they may even grow to resent the parent for their trickery, even if the parent was kind to them.
