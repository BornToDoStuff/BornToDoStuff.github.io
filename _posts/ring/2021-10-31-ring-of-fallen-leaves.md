This ring is a complicated tangle of copper and bronze oak leaves. It magically resizes to fit any finger you put it on.  
This item holds 10 charges and regains 1 expended charge each day at dawn.  
While attuned to this ring you can identify the type of any tree you can see, and have proficiency in Intelligence(Nature) checks.

### Plane of Perpetual Autumn
While attuned with this ring you are aware of, and in control of, the associated demiplane. This demiplane is a lush deciduous forest with a giant oak many times larger than normal at the center. The trees in this forest are always beautiful warm tones with the occasional purple. You can walk for several miles in any direction before finding the edge of the demiplane. If you concentrate, you know of all creatures within the demiplane and where they are.

### Ever-present Portal
As an action you can expend 2 charges to create a portal to the demiplane or a portal from the demiplane to the Prime Material plane that lasts for 1 hour or until you create another portal. This costs 1 less charge if you create the portal near a Huge or larger oak tree.  
The portal you create is 5 feet wide, 10 feet tall, and is bordered by saplings and branches. You can expend an additional 2 charges to double the size of the portal. 
When you create a portal to the material plane you can choose any location you are very familiar with, or a permanent teleport circle. When you create a portal to the demiplane you can choose any location within it.

If you create a portal in the same location for 8 consecutive days that portal becomes permanent unless you have at least 1 charge and expend all your remaining charges to destroy it.
