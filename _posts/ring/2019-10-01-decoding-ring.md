This ring is made of two parts, both covered in letters and runes so small you have trouble reading them without a magnifying glass, that rotate independently of each other. While wearing this ring you can spend a number of minutes equal to 6 minus your Intelligence modifier studying a page of a book, glyphs on a wall, scroll, or other section of writing, to discern its literal meaning no matter what language it is in.
