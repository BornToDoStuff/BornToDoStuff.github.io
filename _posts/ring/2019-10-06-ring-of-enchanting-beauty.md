This delicate ring has a rose carved from a shining ruby as it's focus. While wearing this ring once per long rest you can activate it as a bonus action. For the next 10 minutes any humanoid that ends its turn within 30 feet of you must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw it is charmed by you until dusk or dawn, whichever is sooner, or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as captivatingly beautiful and charismatic, regardless of your appearance.
