This ring is set with three black opals in an ornately shaped silver band.

Once per short rest at the end of a hostile creature's turn you can teleport to an unoccupied space up to 60 feet away in a puff of purple smoke. You can then make a melee attack with advantage against a creature within reach.
Additionally, once per day at the end of a hostile creature's turn you can take the attack action as if it is your turn.

<!--excerpt-->
<div id="curse">
**Curse.** If you use either of this ring's features the first attack roll against you within the next minute has advantage. If this attack hits you you take an additional 2d8 Necrotic damage.
