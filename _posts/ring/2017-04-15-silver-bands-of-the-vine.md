These three silver rings are elegantly simple but subtly different from each other. They magically adjust to fit your first finger, second finger, and thumb. All three are etched with incredibly detailed vines and leaves on both the inside and outside. 
While attuned as an action you can call out to one or more rings to activate them or deactivate them.
When activated each ring expands to a large razor sharp chakram in your hand, still etched with their designs which enlarge with them. These chakram are melee weapons that have the properties thrown (range 30/120), finesse, and deal 1d6 slashing damage. As a bonus action you can call to one or more chakram and they will return to your hand if possible, moving around obstacles and creatures to do so.
