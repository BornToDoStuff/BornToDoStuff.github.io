These three silver bands are simple yet elegant, similar but subtly different, and sized to fit different fingers. Vines and leaves etched into both the inside and outside. When they are not being worn by another creature you can call the name of any number of the rings you are attuned to to activate them as an action. They can be attuned to separately by different creatures or as a single item by one creature. Budo activates the smallest of the rings, Vignes activates the middle one, and the largest's name is Reben.

When activated each ring expands to a large metal chakram, perfectly smooth except for their etchings, and razor sharp. These chakram have the properties thrown (range 30/90), finesse, and deal 1d6 slashing damage. Additionally, as part of your attack action you can call a ring by name and it will return to your hand.
