This dagger has a blade of pure un-breaking ice on a hilt of cold steel. Its jagged edge is only further accentuated by the shards protruding from it. There are 6 large shards and on each successful attack one lodges itself within the target. For each shard stuck in the target it takes 1d4 cold damage at the start of its turn. The shards can be removed as action but they melt within 10 minutes once detached from the dagger and cannot be re-attached. All expended shards regenerate at dawn.
