Judging by the materials used this warpick was made to last several lifetimes. It’s head is made of pure adamantine and it’s handle is carved from ancient zurkhwood. It has 4 charges and regains 1 expended charge each day at dawn.  
Whenever you hit a hard object, such as metal or stone, with this warpick the hit is a critical hit. Additionally, you score a critical hit against armored creatures on a roll of 19 or 20.

### Piercing Tip
As an action, you can focus on the warpick and strike an object made of stone or ice, expending a charge. As the pick cleaves through it pulverizes up to a 5-foot cube of material.
