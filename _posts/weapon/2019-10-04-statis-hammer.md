This hammer has radiating lines carved into each of its faces and a small metal sundial on its handle.
It has 3 charges and regains all expended charges each day at dawn.   
When you hit a creature with this hammer you can expend a charge to force the target to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Creatures holding a hammer of any type automatically succeed on this saving throw. On a failure, they are frozen in place and the world appears to fast forward in front of their eyes.  
For the next minute they can not be interacted with in any way, they are immune to all damage, their movement speed is 0, and they are incapacitated. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect early on a success.
