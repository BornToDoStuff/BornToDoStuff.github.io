This small crossbow has several modifications to the channel and string that make it almost impossible to fire a regular crossbow bolt. You will find however, that it is deadly accurate while firing chalk. When you fire a piece of chalk at a target with this weapon on a successful hit it does 1 + your Dexterity modifier bludgeoning damage, and on contact pulverizes into a fine 5 foot cloud. Any creatures within the cloud must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be Blinded until the end of your next turn as chalk gets in their eyes.
