This sword is made from a well weathered wood, but its hilt and handle are yet covered with bark, and carefully molded. It flexes, but doesn’t splinter, and it’s edge is as sharp as steel. Any damage that has been done to the sword is repaired at dawn as long as the blade has been dipped in water within the last day and the handle is still intact.

As an action you can drive the blade into the ground if it is earth or sand. As you do so grasping vines and weeds sprout from the ground and a few leaves grow from the hilt of the sword. The sword casts <magic-spell>Entangle</magic-spell> on the ground around it in a 10 foot radius with a spell save DC of 15. This effect lasts until it is removed from the ground. Any creatures touching the hilt of this sword when it is driven into the ground are immune to this effect.
