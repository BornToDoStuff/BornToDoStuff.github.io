This magical greatsword is unusually broad and has a gap through the width of the blade starting halfway up from the handle. The metal is pocked and dull as if it was never polished, and has no hilt. In place of the hilt it has an unsharpened spike forged from the blade and running parallel with the handle.

As a bonus action you can speak the command word to transform Moonscraper from a greatsword into a shield the shape of a thick crescent moon or back into a greatsword. While holding Moonscraper in shield form with both hands you gain a +3 shield bonus to your AC, but otherwise you can not benefit.  
Additionally, while Moonscraper is in shield form you can attempt to shove a creature within 15 feet of you by throwing the shield as an attack action. When thrown in this way the shield returns to you at the end of your turn.
