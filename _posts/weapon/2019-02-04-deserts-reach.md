This halberd's angular head is made from a glistening bronze, and its handle is a highly polished light ash.

Once per short rest as an action you can sweep the halberd around you to create a 30-foot-radius sphere of thick whirling sand centered on you.  
The cloud of sand spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured for all creatures except you. The cloud lingers in the air for the next minute or until a strong wind disperses it.  
Each creature, except yourself, that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw DC 13. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn coughing and can not speak. Creatures that donâ€™t need to breathe automatically succeed this saving throw.

While you are holding the halberd you can cast the <magic-spell>Mold Earth</magic-spell> cantrip and you can have up to 4 of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time. Additionally, for the sake of any spells or cantrips you know, including <magic-spell>Mold Earth</magic-spell>, sand is now treated as dirt.
