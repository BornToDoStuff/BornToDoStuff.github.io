This weapon is tarnished and dingy, as if it has been exposed to the elements for far too long, but is not rusted. You can not find its sheath anywhere and its handle is bare metal with no wrapping. 

You can activate this weapon as a bonus action. As you activate it you hear a cacophony of jumbled whispers and the weapon seems to almost guide itself towards its target, leaving a sickly blue trail behind it. While it is activated you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this weapon. 

After it has been activated for one minute you must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure you take 1d12 Psychic damage as the voices crowd your mind and your vision flashes white. On a success you take half as much damage.
For every minute the weapon is activated you gain an additional +1 to hit with this weapon. However, for every minute the weapon is active you must make another DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, and the damage you take increases by 1d12. 

Each time you make a Wisdom saving throw against this weapon's effect you may choose to try to break free from it. On a success you take no damage and the weapon is deactivated. On a failure you are unable to clear the voices from your head and you take damage as normal.

<div class="curse">
**Curse.** When you attune to this weapon you make a binding pact with an ancient one. If you die while attuned to this weapon or go unconscious while the weapon is activated your soul will be trapped within the weapon as one of the many voices, and just as all the other souls, you can not be released until a favor for the ancient one has been completed by another person. If you un-attune with this weapon before completing a favor for the ancient one you are certain you will suffer great misfortune.
