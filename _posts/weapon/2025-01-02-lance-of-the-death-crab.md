This lance is made from the leg of an enormous crab, honed to a razor tip. When you attack an undead creature this lance does Radiant damage instead of Piercing, and if it hits an undead with a CR of 1/2 or lower it immediately dies.  
Additionally, this lance is not affected by water, or being underwater, and does not require two hands to wield while underwater.
