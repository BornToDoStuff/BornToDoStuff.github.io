This scimitar is made from a single massive pincer knapped to what could be called a blade. Its jagged edges almost tear more than slice, and the wounds it leaves are not for the faint of heart.  
On a critical hit with this weapon you deal an additional 1d6 Acid damage. Additionally, the target creature screams out in pain and until the end of their next turn has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. If the creature was concentrating on a spell they automatically fail the Constitution saving throw to maintain their concentration.
