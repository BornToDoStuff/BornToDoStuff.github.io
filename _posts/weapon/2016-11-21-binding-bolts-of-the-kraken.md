These bolts have mottled heads emblazoned with the tentacled symbol of Panzuriel. If one of these arrows draws blood the symbol on its head glows a deep amber before exploding in a cloud of yellow and black energy. The creature damaged by this arrow must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save the creature takes an additional 2d8 necrotic damage. On a failed save tentacles of a size proportional to the target creature erupt from the wound and they take an additional 4d8 necrotic damage.

These tentacles remain on the creature for 1 minute unless they are removed with Remove Curse, or Greater Restoration. If the tentacles remain on the creature for the entire duration the target creature incurs one level of exhaustion as they shrivel up.
The tentacles have a mind of their own and attempt to restrain up to 3 creatures within 5 feet of the target. The targets of the attempted grapples must beat a DC equal to 14 + the target creatureï¿½s Strength modifier or be grappled.

Other types of magical ammunition of this kind exist, such as arrows meant for a bow, though bolts are the most common.
