This quarterstaff still has its bark on it except for where a long oriental dragon twists around it, carefully carved, sanded, and oiled to a sheen.

As an action you can attempt to shove a large or smaller creature within 30 feet of you with a swipe of this weapon. As you do so they feel a strong warm wind suddenly buffet them. If you succeed they are pushed 10 feet directly away from you by the gust. You can choose to make this shove with disadvantage to slide them 5 feet in a direction of your choice instead.

Additionally, once per long rest as an action you can cast the spell <magic-spell>Burning Hands</magic-spell> originating from the maw of the carved dragon.

Other polearm variations of this type exist, such as a glaive or halberd, though all variations have the same dragon carved into their shaft.
