This quarterstaff still has its bark on it except for where a long oriental dragon twists around it, carefully carved, sanded, and oiled to a sheen.

As an attack action you can attempt to shove a creature within 15 feet of you with a swipe of this weapon as a strong warm wind suddenly buffets them. If you attempt to push them with the shove and succeed they are pushed 10 feet directly away from you. Alternatively, you can make the shove check with disadvantage to push them 5 feet in any direction of your choice.
Additionally, once per long rest as an action you can cast the spell <magic-spell>Burning Hands</magic-spell> originating from the maw of the carved dragon.

Other polearm variations of this type exist, such as a glaive or halberd, though all variations have the same dragon carved into their shaft.
