This warhammer is more stockily built than most and the sides of its blocky head are covered in silver inlays. As you attune to it you feel a weight come upon you as if you have taken on a great responsibility.

Once per short rest as an action you can slam the hammer to the ground and it begins eminating a crushing aura. For the next minute or until you pick up the hammer, whichever comes first, all creatures within 60 feet of the hammer must make a Strength saving throw at the beginning of each turn equal to 8 + your proficiency + your Charisma modifier. You can choose a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier to automatically succeed this saving throw. On a failure every foot of movement costs 1 extra foot until the beginning of their next turn and if the creature is an Aberration, Fiend, or Undead they also fall Prone. If a creature that is already Prone fails this saving throw they become Restrained until they are no longer in the aura.

<div class="curse">
**Curse.** While attuned to this item you constantly feel a heavy burden on your mind and shoulders, and your movement speed is reduced by 5 feet. If you remove this curse you hear whispered in your mind "those who are not willing to bear the burden are not worthy to wield me", the attunement immediately breaks, and you can never attune to the hammer again.
