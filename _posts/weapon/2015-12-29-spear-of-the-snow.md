This spear has an uncommonly large head with a blueish hue and an intricate etching of a winter landscape across it. When thrown it creates a billowing cloud of snowflakes in a 10-foot radius from the point it strikes that heavily obscures the area until the end of your next turn.

Additionally, as an action you can drive the spear into the ground, creating a 15-foot radius of frost and ice. Stagnant and slow moving water within this area is also frozen, and any nonmagical fires are extinguished. This area remains frozen and is considered difficult terrain until the beginning of the turn after you remove the spear from the ground.
