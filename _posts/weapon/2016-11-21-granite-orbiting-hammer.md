This rotund hammer is made from a gray granite flecked with gold and black. It weighs 6 pounds, has the heavy property, and a short chain attached to its metal handle.

While wielding this hammer you can begin swinging it by the chain to build up momentum as an action. While this hammer is swinging it does an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage. On a critical failure the hammer loses its momentum and you must begin swinging again.
