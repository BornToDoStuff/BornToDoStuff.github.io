This halberd’s angular head is made from a glistening bronze, and its handle is carved out of light ash. This item has 4 charges, and regains all expended charges each day at dawn, or when exposed to a natural sandstorm.  
As an action you can expend a charge and sweep the halberd across the ground to create a 30-foot-radius sphere of thick whirling sand centered on you. This cloud of sand spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured for all creatures except you. The cloud lingers in the air for the next minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Each creature, except yourself, that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw DC 15. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn coughing and can not speak. Creatures that don’t need to breathe automatically succeed this saving throw.
