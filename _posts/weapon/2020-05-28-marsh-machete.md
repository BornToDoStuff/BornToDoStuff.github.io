This small blade, embellished with a fine script, was forged to venture through the swamps and bogs with ease. This blade deals double damage to plants and plant type creatures. Additionally, you, and any creatures moving directly behind you, are able to ignore difficult terrain caused by plants or brush by chopping at the vegetation.
