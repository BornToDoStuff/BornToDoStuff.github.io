This elegant longbow is made of a bright gold, and despite its overbearing size draws with ease that defies common sense making this bow's range twice that of a regular longbow. This bow contains 8 charges and regains all expended charges each day at dawn.
While attuned you are granted divine health by the gods themselves and are immune to all disease and poisons as well as the poisoned condition.

## Aim of Delphi

At the beginning of your turn you can choose to expend a charge to activate the bow until the end of your turn. While the bow is activated you may make attacks against any creature within range with advantage, even if they have full cover. When you do so, the arrows disappear in mid-flight, suddenly reappearing at their target.

## Bringer of Healing and Plagues

When you make a successful attack with this weapon you may choose to expend a charge to cast <magic-spell>Blight</magic-spell> on the target you hit or to cast <magic-spell>Mass Cure Wounds</magic-spell> at the point the arrow strikes. Your spellcasting modifier for this effect is +5 or your own spellcasting modifier, whichever is higher.

## Averter of Evil

When you make a successful attack with this weapon against an undead or fiend you instantly destroy it if its challenge rating is 2 or lower. If it is not destroyed it takes an additional 2d6 Radiant damage.
