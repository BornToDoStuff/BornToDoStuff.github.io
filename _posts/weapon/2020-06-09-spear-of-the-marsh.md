This spear has a shaft of aged ash, and it’s constantly dripping head is rusted from being perpetually damp. 

### Highlands
As an action, you can drive the spear into dry ground and create a cylinder of brackish murky water 5 feet deep and 15 feet in diameter centered on the spear. The water will not flow outside this cylindrical space it is confined to.  
When you remove the spear as a bonus action the water is violently sucked back into the tip of the spear and any creature, except you, inside the brackish water must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet towards you.

### Lowlands
As an action, you can plunge the spear into water 5 feet deep or less to create a 15 foot radius of dry land. Water that enters this area is repelled to the sides.  
When you remove the spear as a bonus action the displaced water erupts out of the tip of the spear in a 20 foot cone. Any creature in this area must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed back 15 feet.
