This straight blade is crafted from a black steel yet it faintly gleams orange in the light. It has grooves etched into the blade visually splitting it into segments and a spike juts from the back of each segment.

**Unnatural Speed.** At the beginning of your turn if you are holding the machete you can choose to activate it. When you do so you can feel the blade grow cold and as it moves it leaves a spectral image of itself for just a moment. Deal 1 Slashing damage to any creatures you choose within 5 feet of you.
Until the end of your turn you have a -5 penalty to all your attack rolls with this weapon, but you can choose to make an Attack action with this weapon as a bonus action.
