This flail has a head made from an astoundingly solid crystal, and as it strikes it resonates with the sound of crunching glass.   
It has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges after a long rest.  

When you hit an object with this flail that is not being worn or carried you can expend a charge to attempt to shatter it if the target object is 1 foot thick or less. Make a DC 15 Strength check and on a success you shatter up to a 5-foot square section. You have advantage on this check if the object is made from glass, crystal, or ice.
