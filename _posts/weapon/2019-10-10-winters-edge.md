This axe is forged from a stark blue alloy and has an intricate mountain range etched on its surface. After dusk it gathers a layer of frost along it's edge, even on hot nights.   
This axe has 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges after a long rest.

When you make a successful attack with this weapon you can expend a charge to deal an additional 1d10 cold damage and force the target to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone as a howling bitter wind follows your blow.
