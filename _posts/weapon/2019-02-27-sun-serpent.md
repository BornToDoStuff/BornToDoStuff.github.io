item_idea: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiuhcoatl 'turquoise lord' and 'lord of fire'. Huitzilopochtli was apparently known for wielding a staff (or atlatl depending on depiction) which was the weapon form of the avatar of Xiuhtecuhtli, a lesser god. This is me taking artistic liberty of that weapon and those deities."

This quarterstaff is made from a pale wood and a segmented serpent is carved along its length with its head at the top of the staff. Its eyes are set with large turquoise and several smaller stones stud its back.    
This item can hold 10 charges and regains 1d10 expended charges each day at dawn if you are not underground when the sun rises.    
As a bonus action you tap the staff on the ground and the eyes shine a cold blue as if the cantrip<magic-spell>Light</magic-spell> was cast on them. You can tap the staff on the ground again to end this effect.    


### Prince of Lightning
While the serpent's eyes are glowing you can choose to expend a charge as an action. When you do so the whole staff crackles with energy and the turquoise stones shine brightly before a searing blue beam erupts in a 1-foot-wide 60-foot-long line from the snake's mouth. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw DC 17. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 Fire damage, 3d8 Lightning damage, and is Blinded until your next turn. On a successful save it takes half as much damage and is not Blinded. Additionally, this effect dispels any magical darkness in its area.

### Lord of Flame
As an action you can expend all remaining charges to create a massive mote of brilliant blue light. All the stones on the staff suddenly pulse and a 10 foot sphere of light coalesces 50 feet above your head. This mote sheds bright light in a 250-foot-radius, and dim light out for an additional 100 feet. It lasts for the next 10 minutes before disappearing with a roar.    
This light is considered sunlight and dispels any magical darkness in its area. Additionally, any creature in the radius that looks at the mote of light must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 17) or be Blinded for the next minute. A creature blinded by this effect may make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, and on a success is no longer Blinded.    
After using this feature you can’t use it again for the next 2d6 days.
