This bow is made from a finely treated wood of a red hue. It has several eagle feathers hanging from a sinew, and if you look closely there are runes of speed and flight penned in white ink along its graceful edge.  
This bow has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dawn. Additionally, itâ€™s normal range is increased by 50 feet and its long range by 200 feet.  
As an action you can expend a charge to activate this bow by running your fingers across the runes. The next attack made within 1 minute can target any creature you can see as if it is within the weapon's normal range and as you fire you can hear the scream of an eagle.
