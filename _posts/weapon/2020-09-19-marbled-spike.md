This marbled stone pick is reinforced with black iron bands. It has obviously been imbued with magic to have lasted this long without shattering. This magical item has 10 charges and regains 1d8+2 expended charges each day at dawn.

### Molehill
If you are standing on soil or stone, as an action you can strike the ground and expend a number of charges while concentrating as if concentrating on a spell, causing the earth to ripple around you. When you do so you target a number of 10-foot square areas of soil or stone within 120 feet, equal to the number of charges expended, which rise up to create a bluff. You can choose for each of these target areas’ sides to slope gradually, or be a sheer cliff up to 10 feet tall, so long as at least one side is an incline. If you maintain concentration on this effect for the next hour the bluffs become permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the bluffs sink back into the earth.

### Mountain
As an action you can target any area you can see that was targeted by the Molehill feature within the past day and expend a charge for each targeted area. At each targeted area a 10-foot square pillar of stone bursts from the ground and rises to a height of up to 20 feet. If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, DC 17, or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save. If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, such as a Huge or larger creature, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature’s choice), DC 17. On a success the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.
