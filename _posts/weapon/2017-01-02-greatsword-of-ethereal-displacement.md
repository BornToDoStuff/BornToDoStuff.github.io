This greatsword has a blade of folded steel that shimmers in the light and a hilt adorned with pearl inlays. When you attune to it you feel a faint presence touch your mind and you hear a whisper through your thoughts. The sword can telepathically communicate with anyone touching it, but it seems far away and is barely audible. It asks you for souls, it does not care of what or whom, to be sent to the ethereal plane. Or in simpler terms, for you to kill.

<!--excerpt-->
### Bloody Displacement
Every time you draw blood with this sword you can feel it's satisfaction. When you successfully hit a creature with this sword you may teleport up to 10 feet, and when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this sword you may teleport up to 30 feet. You must teleport to an unoccupied space when you teleport in this manner.

### Otherworldly Movement
Once per short rest as an action while holding the sword you can cast <magic-spell>Blink</magic-spell>.

### Planar Beacon
When this sword is driven into the ground it can serve as a destination sigil for a spell such as <magic-spell>Teleport</magic-spell> or other similar teleport spells. In order to use it as a destination the caster must know the sigil sequence for the sword which the currently attuned creature can teach to anyone they choose. If a creature attempts to teleport to the sword while it is not driven into the ground the spell fails and is wasted.

Additionally, any creature that has touched the sword within the past 24 hours can take a knee and mentally reach out to the sword as an action. If they are on the same plane as the sword, within 1 mile, and if the sword is still driven into the ground from since they last touched it they are teleported to a random unoccupied space within 10 feet of the sword. Any creature teleported in this manner is Incapacitated for 1 minute as they recover from being forcefully shunted through the Ethereal Plane.

<div class="curse">
**Curse.** After using any feature of this sword you are Deafened for 1 minute almost as if your sense of hearing hasn't returned along with your body after traveling through the Ethereal Plane.

You are Deafened while on the Ethereal plane and all you can hear is the voice of the sword loud and clear almost as if it is resounding all around you. Your hearing can not return to normal until you leave the Ethereal plane.
