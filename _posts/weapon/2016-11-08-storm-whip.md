This leather whip has a long metal handle that crackles with electricity when you arenâ€™t holding it. It can be used like any other whip, but deals Lightning damage instead of Slashing. If you are proficient with whips as an action you can cause one of the following effects.
- The tip of the whip begins to pulse with a bright light. You flick it at a point in the air with a loud pop and all creatures within 5 feet of a point you choose within 10 feet must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure they are Blinded for 1 minute. They can repeat this save at the end of their turn.
- The metal handle crackles and the air around you tingles. You target one Large or smaller creature within 30 feet as the now electrified whip lashes out with surprising range. The targeted creature must succeed a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + your proficiency or be pulled up to 15 feet in a straight line towards you. The targeted creature takes 1d4 Lightning damage for every 5 feet it is pulled.
