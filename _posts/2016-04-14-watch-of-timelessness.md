This simple pocket watch is mesmerizing to a fault. Any creature that checks the time is momentarily hypnotized. They feel slightly disoriented and are unable to read a map or discern cardinal directions for the next minute making it very easy for them to become lost. Itâ€™s somehow cheering though, and if a creature takes a bonus action to pull it out of their pocket to check on it they gain an extra spring in their step and +10 movement speed.
