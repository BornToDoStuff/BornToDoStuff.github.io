When unrolled underwater it quickly re-rolls itself and constricts into to a slender bamboo shoot about 5 feet long. It is hollow, and while very narrow the user will find they can breathe through it as if it isnâ€™t even there. The scroll will remain in this form for the next hour during which for all intents and purposes it is a length of bamboo. At the end of the hour it will collapse into a soggy sheet of parchment.
