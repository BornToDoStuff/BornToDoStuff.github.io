This simple leather messenger bag was made by an eccentric sorcerer who was irritated that his component pouch was constantly so disorganized. It has as many or as few pockets as the wearer needs, up to 20 pockets. Each time the pouch is opened the contents are neatly organized even if they were not when it was closed and it has a free pocket for anything you are holding that fits into the bag. It always weighs 5 pounds, empty or full, and can hold up to 20 pounds of goods as long as they fit into the mouth of the satchel.
