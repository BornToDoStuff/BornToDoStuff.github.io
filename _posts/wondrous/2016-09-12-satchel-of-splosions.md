Besides the small holes and scorch marks riddling this bag it looks like an average leather satchel. It appears to have nothing in it but if you reach in without looking you feel several large stones.
As a bonus action a creature can reach into the bag and pull out a small fist sized stone that begins smoking. At the end of the creatureâ€™s next turn it will shatter with a low crack and a small flash of light. The crack can be heard from 100 feet away and the stone explodes into small fragments dealing 1d10 piercing damage to all creatures within 5 feet. Using the satchel in this way expends 1 charge.
This Satchel has 4 charges, and it regains all expended charges each day at dawn .
A creature can throw one of the exploding stones as an attack, it counts as an improvised ranged weapon and has a range of 30 feet.
If the creature wearing or holding the satchel takes more than 5 fire damage or the satchel takes fire damage directly a stone explodes.
