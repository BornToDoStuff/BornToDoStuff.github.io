This hardy wine bottle is completely opaque and holds a strong, deep red alcohol but it cannot be poured out, only drunk from. It can be depleted but any liquid poured into the flask is instantly transformed into an equal amount of alcohol and any poison is nullified. Any creature that has drunk from the decanter knows the direction of the nearest alcohol within 10 miles (besides the decanter) for the next hour.
