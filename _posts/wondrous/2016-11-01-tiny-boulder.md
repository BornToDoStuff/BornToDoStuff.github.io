This pebble appears as normal on first inspection. On closer inspection it seems as if it has excruciating detail, each little crevice and crack smaller than normal. Typically 3d6+2 Tiny Boulders are found together in a small leather pouch.
As an attack action you can throw it 30 feet or sling it 60 feet. When the pebble strikes a surface or is crushed it rapidly expands into a large boulder. Each creature within a 5 foot radius must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 6d10 bludgeoning damage, half on a successful save.
