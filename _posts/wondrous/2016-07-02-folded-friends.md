These 6 inch squares of paper are beautifully flowered on one side and some even gilded. On the other side they are blank except for an intricately inked magic circle.
When someone begins to fold them they continue folding themselves until they begin to resemble a creature and become animated, although they don’t increase in size and only stand a few inches tall. These little helpers last until they are damaged or become wet and are loyal to whoever began folding the paper.
With a little practice anyone can learn how to create one they have before or even something new. There are three common shapes though.

#### Humanoid
These little guys can only lift up to 5 pounds but are quite dextrous with their hands, and able to follow rather complex orders.
#### Elephant
Their triangular build makes them much stronger than most other transformations and they are able to carry and lift up to 15 pounds. They aren’t smart but they can still follow simple two or three word commands.
#### Bird
Unfortunately unable to sing, this little bird is able to carry messages written on it, or with it, to a specific location. If shown on a map where to take it and told to “fly” it will be able to navigate exactly to where you pointed, and do its best to fly around storms. It can also return to where it was folded by being told to “go home”.
