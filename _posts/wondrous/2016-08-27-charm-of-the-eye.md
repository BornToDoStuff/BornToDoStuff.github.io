This small golden amulet is about an inch across and resembles an eye closed over an inlaid ruby. It hangs on three frail chains coming from each corner of the eye. While wearing this amulet, you may make up to two attacks of opportunity per turn, but not against the same creature. The first attack of opportunity costs a reaction as normal but after you take the first the second is free.

<section id="curse">
**Curse.** When a creature puts this necklace over their head it tightens around their temples and the eye snaps open. It cannot be taken off unless the curse is removed and the chains cannot be broken despite their dainty appearance.
While wearing this charm you have disadvantage on saving throws against being blinded, and disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against Beholders, Death Tyrants and Spectators. If you are charmed by any of these creatures the duration of the charm is permanent unless the curse is removed or the enchantment is broken by <magic-spell>Dispel Evil and Good</magic-spell>.
