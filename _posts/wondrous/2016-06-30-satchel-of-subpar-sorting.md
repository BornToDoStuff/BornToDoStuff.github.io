This satchel appears in every way to be a Satchel of Superior Sorting and functions very similarly, it is a failed experiment by the same sorcerer that created the Sorting Satchel after all. But each time a pocket is created if there are more than 10 pockets total roll 1d20. On a 1 pick a pocket at random and that pocket is emptied into another dimension.
