While wearing this ring you regenerate quickly as long as you have food. When you take a long or short rest if you eat a hot meal during the rest you gain temporary hit points equal to two of your hit dice that last until your next rest and also lose one level of exhaustion. However, whenever you are healed any temporary hit points you gained in this way are destroyed.
Additionally, it never takes you longer than 1 hour to regain consciousness.
