This cloudy white orb has a scarlet sheen to it and when you stare into its depths you see shadows flickering throughout it. It weighs 3 pounds and is the size of a grapefruit. You can discover the commands for the orb by studying it's depths for a short rest. When you study the orb it will reveal it's command words in gnomish script within the shadows. As an attack action, you may speak a command word while holding the orb to do one of the following:
- You absorb a light or thrown weapon you are holding into the orb. If it is already holding 10 such weapons, nothing happens.
- You pull out a weapon of your choice that is stored in orb. If you do not have a free hand to pull it from the orb it falls to the ground.
- You expel a weapon of your choice from the orb and it flies towards a creature. Make a ranged weapon attack with proficiency. This attack's range is 20/60 and does the same damage as the weapon would normally do.
