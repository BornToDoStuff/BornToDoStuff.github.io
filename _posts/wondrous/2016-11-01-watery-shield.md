This crystal orb is filled with water and has no visible opening but is covered in magic runes. If you learn the proper command word from the runes you can speak the command word to allow the water to permeate the orb and create one of two effects.

- The water coalesces around you like a coating of mucus. You are able to breathe as normal but are completely covered with 1 inch barrier of magical water for 1 minute. Fire is unable to pass through the barrier but all other effects and objects are. While the barrier is active you are considered immune to fire damage.
- The water forms a 20 foot square wall that is 1 inch thick, oriented as you choose. This wall remains for 1 minute and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. In addition, beings from the plane of fire must make a DC 18 Constitution check to pass through the wall. 

When the effect ends the water falls to the ground and loses all magical properties. The orb refills each day at dawn or if it is on the plane of water it refills after 1 hour.
