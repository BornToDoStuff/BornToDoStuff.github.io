This delicate white teacup is fit for a nobleman, but will not chip or crack. It has been rumored to have been originally found when it was flung through a window, carried from a shipment of china by a violent storm. While you are attuned to the teacup you can gain up to 5 charges that can be used to activate the magic of the teacup.

### Calm Before the Storm
During a short rest if you drink tea from this teacup you regain all expended charges and your exhaustion decreases by 1 level. The tea can be of any type but must be hot when you drink it. You also regain 1 charge each long rest that you take.

### Cyclone
As an action while raging you can expend a charge to attack your enemies with the strength of the storm. As the winds swirl around you you make long sweeping attacks at all enemies within 5 feet. All hostile creatures within range must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency + your strength modifier. On a failed save they take damage equivalent to two of your weapon attacks.

### Heart of the Storm
When you activate your rage you can choose to expend all 5 charges to release the full power of the tempest. A 20-foot radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence centered on you that follows you until your rage ends. Each creature (not including you) that ends its turn in the sphere must succeed a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency + your strength modifier. On a failed save they take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Additionally the sphere’s space is difficult terrain for all creatures besides you.
