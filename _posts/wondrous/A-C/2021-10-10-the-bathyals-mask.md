This tarnished silver mask covers the bottom of your face and is heavily inlaid with turquoise and coral. This item has 12 charges and regains 2d6 expended charges each day at dawn.

### Breath of the Deep
As an action while wearing this mask you can expend a charge to activate it, sealing it tightly to your face. For the next hour you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on Saving Throws made against harmful gases and vapors.

### Tidal Pressure
As an action you can expend a number of charges to create a 30-foot sphere of brackish water, within 120 feet of you, for each charge spent. These spheres last for 10 minutes before evaporating. Any creature inside these spheres must make a DC 16 Strength check to move outside of the sphere.  
Additionally, as an action you can expend a number of charges to target that many creatures inside the brackish spheres. Each targetted creature must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw as the water churns around them. On a failure, the target creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage and is Restrained. On a success they take half as much damage and are not Restrained. A Restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
