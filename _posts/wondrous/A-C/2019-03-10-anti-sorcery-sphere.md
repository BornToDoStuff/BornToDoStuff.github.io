Designed in an attempt to destroy magic itself, this black sphere looks benign compared to its aspirations. Itâ€™s a small 6-inch sphere covered in criss-crossing etchings, and it has a light sheen to it. It is completely immune to all damage, magic or otherwise.  
This item has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges each day at dawn. While you are attuned with this item as a reaction to a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell you can expend a charge to cast <magic-spell>Counterspell</magic-spell> with a spellcasting ability of +10.  

Additionally, as an action you can expend a charge to open the sphere. When you do so it fractures along the etched lines revealing a neon orange core swirling with yellow. For the next minute an antimagic field surrounds the orb as if created by the spell <magic-spell>Antimagic Field</magic-spell>. During this time the sphere is not immune to non-magical damage and if it takes more than 25 damage in a single day it is destroyed. If the sphere is destroyed an immense blast of energy washes over the landscape. All creatures within 100 feet of the sphere take 8d6 force damage and a 1 mile sphere of antimagic is created, centered on the point the sphere was destroyed. This antimagic field lasts for 1d4 years and can not be ended early.
