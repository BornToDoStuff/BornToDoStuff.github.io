This metal rod is about 4 feet long and straight most of the way down before telescoping to a small metal foot. It has two handles welded to the top that look like they were hacked off of a teapot, and two folding flaps attached just before the shaft begins tapering.

When you press down on the rod the tapering section resists but eventually collapses in on itself as if it has a complex spring mechanism underneath it.
As a bonus action you can unfold the flaps and stand on them, one foot on each side of the rod, and as you do so you begin to bounce slightly.

Whenever you jump while riding the jumping stick you add 1d6 to your jump height or length. If this roll is lower than your dexterity modifier you can instead use your dexterity modifier.
While riding the jumping stick if you enter rough terrain or fail a dexterity saving throw you automatically fall prone. However, enemies have disadvantage on attacks of opportunity against you.
