These boots are made from a rubbery animal hide and come up to your knees. The soles are especially thick and have a glowing green rune on the heel. While wearing these boots you are able to walk across the top of water, mud, or bog, so long as it is not deeper than 5 feet. If it is deeper than 5 feet you sink until your feet are 5 feet from the bottom.  
Additionally, you ignore nonmagical difficult terrain caused by water, mud, or swamps.
