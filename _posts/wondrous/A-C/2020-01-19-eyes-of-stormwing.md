This imposing half mask is made to resemble an eagle and its dark feathers contrast the piercing golden eyes. While wearing the mask you are able to see objects as if they were within arms reach even if they are as far as the horizon so long as conditions are clear. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, but are unable to use darkvision while wearing the mask.
