This black chunk of obsidian is roughly a round shape and has no sharp edges. As you look into its cloudy depths you can see an almost infinitely receding sea of gold, white, and blue flecks of color. When you hold it you can swear you can hear how silent it is even through the chaos around you.

This item has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend a number of its charges to create a sphere of swirling emptiness at a point within 60 feet of you. The radius of the sphere is equal to the number charges expended x 10. Space itself begins to warp within the area and each Large or smaller creature within the sphere must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. On a failed save they are pulled up to 10 feet to the closest unoccupied space near the center of the vortex. On a successful save they take 1d8 force damage and are not moved.

This item regains all of its expended charges after a long or short rest.

<section id="curse">
**Curse.** The first time this item is used after a long or short rest the user must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 Necrotic damage for each charge they expended as a tiny piece of their life force is pulled into Limbo. This damage can not be resisted and if a creature goes unconscious from taking this damage a gate appears beneath them and they are sucked through it to Limbo. This gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
