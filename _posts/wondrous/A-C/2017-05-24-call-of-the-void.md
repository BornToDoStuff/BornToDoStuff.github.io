This black chunk of obsidian is a rough spherical shape with no sharp edges. As you look into its murky center you can see an almost infinitely receding sea of gold, white, and blue flecks of color. When you hold it you can swear you can hear how silent it is.

This item has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend a number of its charges to create a sphere of swirling emptiness at a point within 120 feet of you. The radius of the sphere is equal to the number charges expended x 10 feet. Space itself begins to warp within the area and each creature within the sphere must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. On a failed save they are pulled to an unoccupied space nearest to the center of the vortex. On a successful save they take 2d8 force damage and are not moved.

This item regains all of its expended charges after a long or short rest.

<!--excerpt-->
<div class="curse">
**Curse.** The first time this item is used after a long or short rest the user takes 1d8 Necrotic damage for each charge they expended as a tiny piece of their life force is pulled into Limbo. This damage can not be resisted and if a creature goes unconscious from taking this damage a gate appears beneath them and they are sucked through it to Limbo. This gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
