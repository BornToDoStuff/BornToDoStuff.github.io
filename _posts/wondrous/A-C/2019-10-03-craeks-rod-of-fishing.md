This thin flexible rod has a sturdy string attached to the end, and a mechanism to release and reel back in the string as needed. Tied to the end of this 50-foot long string is a small hook. When either the hook or string is broken it quickly grows back as the detached hook and string disintegrate.  
As an action, you can make a ranged attack using this rod against a Large or smaller creature within 30 feet if you. You may add proficiency to this attack if you are proficient in Dexterity (Sleight of Hand). On a hit, the creature becomes tangled in the string and is grappled (escape DC 16). While a creature is grappled in this way you may pull them 10 feet towards you as an action. The grapple ends if they end their turn farther than 30 feet away, you drop the fishing line, or another creature detangles them as an action.    
Additionally, when trying to catch fish with this item you may make any related checks with advantage.
