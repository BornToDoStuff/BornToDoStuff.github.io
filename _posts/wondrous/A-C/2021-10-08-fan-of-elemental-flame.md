This fan has a beautifully engraved case of brass and each time you open it has a different vibrant design on its face.  
As a bonus action you can open this fan, which stays open for the next minute or until you close it again. When you open the fan its design, which corresponds to an element, is chosen randomly by rolling a d6. The elements are as follows: Acid, Cold, Lightning, Necrotic, Poison, and Radiant.  
After opening this fan if you use it as a spellcasting focus to cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals Fire damage, you can replace half of the spell's damage dice (rounded down) with the damage type chosen by the fan.
