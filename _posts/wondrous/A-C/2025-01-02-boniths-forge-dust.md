This dust made from powdered bioluminescent insects and the bones of a single creature type can be used as an additive during the forging process for metal weapons. Up to three weapons can be coated in this dust while being smithed. Weapons coated in this way faintly glow when within 100 feet of any creature of the same type as the bones used. The closer the creature is, the brighter it glows.
