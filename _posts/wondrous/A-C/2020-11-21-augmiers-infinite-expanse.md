This crystal orb is a matte white with no distinguishing factors whatsoever, and yet it has a mesmerizing quality when you gaze into it. While attuned to this orb you have advantage on saving throws against the spells <magic-spell>Banishment</magic-spell>, <magic-spell>Maze</magic-spell>, and <magic-spell>Imprisonment</magic-spell>.  

As an action you can touch a creature with the orb and force it to make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a success they feel incredibly parched, but are otherwise unaffected. On a failure the target creature is transported to a demiplane of infinite desert. Each minute a creature trapped within the demiplane must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure they gain 1 level of exhaustion. On a success, or when they reach 3 or more levels of exhaustion, they are expelled from the demiplane and reappear in the nearest unoccupied space to where they left. Once used this feature can not be used again until your next long or short rest.
