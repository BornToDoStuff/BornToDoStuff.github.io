This bracelet is made from spider silk and littered with bits of carapace and tiny spines. While attuned to this bracelet you constantly have insects and bugs harmlessly following you as if drawn to you.  
As a bonus action you can direct these vermin towards a target within 60 feet. The target creature must succeed a DC 14 Constitution saving throw have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.  
Additionally, as an action, you can summon up to ten Giant Centipedes, six Swarms of Beetles, or three Giant Spiders, to empty spaces within 30 feet of you. Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. Once you have used this feature you can not use it again until you take a long rest.
