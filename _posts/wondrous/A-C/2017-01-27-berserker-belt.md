This black leather belt has a large brass buckle and blood stains deeply ingrained in it.

Once per long rest as an action, or at the same time you enter a rage if you have the Rage feature, you can activate the belt. As you do so the buckle begins bleeding as if it is alive, and your vision tints red. For the next minute you have disadvantage on all Intelligence checks and ability checks that rely on sight.
Additionally, for the next minute each time you take damage, unless the damage was dealt to your temporary hit points, the belt gains 1 charge, up to 10 charges.

At the beginning of your turn you gain a number of temporary hit points that last 1 hour equal to the charges in the belt.
At the end of the minute all charges in the belt are expended and you gain 1 level of exhaustion.
