This leather pouch contains 2d10 small light blue beans that are chill to the touch. As an action you can plant one of these beans at your feet. The turn after a bean is planted thick spiked vines rapidly sprout, so as long as it is not planted in a hot or desert area, and the bean is consumed. A 20-foot square centered on the bean becomes difficult terrain and any creature who enters or starts their turn in the area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw taking 2d6 cold damage from the vine's freezing spikes on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A creature unaffected by the difficult terrain takes no damage.
