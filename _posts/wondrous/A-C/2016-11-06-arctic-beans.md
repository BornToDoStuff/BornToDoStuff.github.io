This leather pouch contains 2d10 small light blue beans that are chill to the touch. As an action you can plant a bean at your feet. The turn after a bean is planted thick spiked vines emitting a cold mist begin growing in a 20-foot square centered on the bean as long as it is not planted in a hot or desert area. This 20-foot square now counts as difficult terrain and any creature who enters or starts their turn in the vines must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, half on a successful one. These vines do not go away unless convinced to hibernate once again by the spell <magic-spell>Speak with Plants</magic-spell> but either way the bean can not be used in this way again.
