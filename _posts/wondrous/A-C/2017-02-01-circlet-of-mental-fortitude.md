This wide gold circlet is set with a single cloudy aquamarine and is etched with a pattern resembling a brick wall.

This circlet has 4 charges, and regains 1d4 charges each day at dawn. When you must make a Wisdom, Charisma, or Intelligence saving throw you can choose to expend a charge to gain advantage on that saving throw.
If you expend a charge in this way while incapacitated you automatically succeed the saving throw, as the effect meets with an impenetrable wall within your mind.

Additionally, when you attune to this item you may pick a mental saving throw, either Wisdom, Charisma, or Intelligence, and are proficient in saving throws using the chosen ability until you un-attune to the circlet.
