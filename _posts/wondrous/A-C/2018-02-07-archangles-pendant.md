This golden pendant is a smooth ellipse shined to a mirror finish. On its face is a pair of feathered wings etched into its surface.

### Divine Light
While wearing this pendant once per short rest as an action you can kneel and concentrate on the pendant as if concentrating on a spell until the beginning of your next turn. Doing so ends your turn, and bathes you in a beam of light, even if you are underground. While you are concentrating on this effect if an undead, fiend, or aberration makes a melee attack against you they automatically miss and are pushed back 10 feet.

At the beginning of your next turn all allies within 30 feet heal for 2d8 hit points and all enemies within 60 feet must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.  
On a failure they take 2d8 Radiant damage and are Blinded until the end of their next turn. On a success they take half as much damage and are not Blinded.

### Angelic Properties
This pendant will not tarnish and can not be dented or scratched. Additionally, while attuned to it you can speak Celestial.

<div id="curse">
**Curse.** If you commit a heinous act the pendant will tarnish slightly and the etching of the wings will glow red for the next day. While the pendant is glowing red you have disadvantage on all ability checks and it feels as if your mind is fogged.
