This small brass charm is a confusing jumble of animal appendages, some of which you have never seen, and hangs from a stout bracelet.  
While wearing this charm you have advantage against any spell that would change your form, such as <magic-spell>Polymorph</magic-spell> or <magic-spell>True Polymorph</magic-spell>. Additionally, if you are a shapechanger you can not use your shapechanger feature until you remove this charm.
