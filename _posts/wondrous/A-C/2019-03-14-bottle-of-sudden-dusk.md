This long glass vial is filled with a constantly shifting smoke as black as night. You can notice subtle blue tones pulsing through the inky darkness if you look closely.  
This item holds 10 charges and regains 1 expended charge each day at sunset.  
As an action you can unstopper this vial, expending a charge to do so. Over the next minute the smoke continues to pour out of the vial seemingly without end and the sky darkens as if the sun has set. All daylight or moonlight within a 5 mile radius becomes darkness for the next hour. Additionally, light sources within this radius only produce dim light.  
For each additional minute the vial is open another charge is expended and the duration of this effect increases by 1 hour. If there are no remaining charges the duration does not increase.
