This item can only be described as an oversized top. It is nearly 2 feet tall, at least as wide, and covered in mottled red spiralling patterns. It is definitely more than a children's plaything though, as when this top begins spinning large blades spring from the seams along it's edges.

As an action you can pull the heavy cord wound through the top to start it spinning, and choose a direction for it to start moving. It moves 15 feet forward at the end of each of your turns and continues spinning for the next minute. 

Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the top while its spinning takes 2d4 Slashing damage. When the top hits a creature in this way, a creature attacks it, or it collides with a solid object, it immediately bounces 5 feet in the opposite direction and it will continue moving in that direction on your next turn. 

If the top ever enters difficult terrain or takes bludgeoning damage it falls over and stops spinning.
