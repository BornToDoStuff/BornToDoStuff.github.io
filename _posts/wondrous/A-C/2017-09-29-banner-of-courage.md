This large blue banner is decorated with a flaring yellow crest and mounted on the end of a 10 foot brass pole. As you hold it you can feel the same sense of self confidence that soldiers must when they know their standard is marching right behind them.
 
The banner has no effect unless it is held aloft by a creature. While holding this banner you can not make any attacks or cast any spells requiring somatic components. While held aloft the banner has an aura that affects all creatures within 250 feet that have either touched it in the last 24 hours, or are wearing a matching crest.

This magical item has 20 charges and regains 2d10 expended charges each day at dawn.

### Symbol of Strength
Creatures affected by the banner are immune to being Frightened and any charm effect that would make them endanger another creature affected by the banner has no effect.

### Bastion of Fortitude
Whenever a creature affected by this banner must make a saving throw that creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to half your charisma modifier rounded up (minimum of 1).

### Surge of Hope
As an action you can wave the banner and expend any number of remaining charges to bolster that many creatures affected by the banner. Each bolstered creature gains temporary hit points equal to 3d6 + your Charisma modifier that last until the banner is no longer aloft. Additionally, they are immune to the effects Blinded, Deafened, and Poisoned, while the temporary hitpoints remain.
