This simple leather pouch has several charred bones in it and a small dusting of ashes. There is no smell of smoke though, so you know these must be quite old.

When attuned to this bag of bones no matter how far you are from them if you are incapacitated a ghostly figure rises from your body. This is not your soul, and you do not know whose it is. You gain the following benefits while incapacitated from this ghostly figure.

Once per turn you can mentally command the wandering soul to deal 1d8 necrotic damage to a creature you do not recognize as an ally within 30 feet. You do not know what or who that creature is, only if it is a creature you already know and if you consider them an ally or not.

Additionally, if a creature makes a melee attack against you they must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 10) or become Frightened of you for the next minute, or until they are farther than 30 feet from you, as their mind is bombarded by the wandering soul.

Lastly, once per turn you can telepathically reach out to a humanoid corpse within 30 feet and determine the answer to a single yes or no question if the creature knew the answer in life. You can ask a corpse up to three questions in this way.

<!--excerpt-->
<div class="curse">
**Curse.** While the wandering soul remains in the bones you can not un-attune from this item unless you are within the area of a Hallow spell. If <magic-spell>Remove Curse</magic-spell> is cast on you or this item the caster must make a DC 16 Intelligence(Arcana) check as the wanderer resists. On a failure the spell does nothing.

If all of the bones are removed from the bag the bones begin to clatter and an Avatar of Death is summoned by the creature that removed the bones. It screeches at the creature for disturbing its slumber and begins attacking it. It is resistant to all damage from any creature except the one that summoned it.

If the Avatar of Death is defeated a putrid black smog wafts out from the bones and they become mundane. If the avatar reduces the creature they were attacking to 0 hit points it places the bones back within the pouch and vanishes.
