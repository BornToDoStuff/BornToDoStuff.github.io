This cheery red pouch has 4d6+4 chalky white pellets in it when you find it. If you cup one or more pellets in your hands and concentrate on them while imagining a taste of a specific food or ingredient they will change color to match that food. The longer you concentrate the stronger the color, and flavor, becomes. When ground or crushed the aroma of the imagined food fills the air, and the resulting powder from the crushed bead tastes exactly as you imagined it.Â 

The flavors you can create are limited only by your imagination, but if your memory or imagination are not clear enough the flavor you get may be of poor quality.
