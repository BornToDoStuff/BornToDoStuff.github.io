This rough semi-translucent crystal is nearly the size of a man's head and quite difficult to see into but appears to have an ever-changing light show within its core. When you find it it has four smaller but almost identical crystals nearby.Â   
All five of these crystals have hammered gold bands around them with large elemental runes chiseled into them. You can identify Fire, Cold, Acid, and Lightning runes on every crystal.  
The main crystal holds 20 charges and regains up to 3d6 expended charges each day at dawn. The child crystals hold no charges, and instead consume charges from the main crystal.  

While you are attuned to this item as a bonus action you may select a damage type from the runes. The selected type determines the type of all child crystals.  
Any creature holding a child crystal, and within 120 feet of the main crystal, may expend a charge and envision striking a target they can see within 120 feet as a bonus action. When they do so a small shimmer flies through the air from the main crystal to the activated child crystal and a magic bolt streams towards the envisioned target dealing 1d4 damage of the selected element.  

When a creature activates a child crystal as a reaction you may choose a number of charges to expend and fire that many additional bolts from their crystal at the target.  
While holding the main crystal you roughly know where each child crystal is at all times as long as it is on the same plane of existance as you.
