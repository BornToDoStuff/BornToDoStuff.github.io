This bold silver circlet has a facet where a gem should sit, but it is empty. While wearing this circlet if you would take psychic damage, any effect or spell tries to read your thoughts, divine your location, or charm you, the circlet activates.  
For the next minute the circlet wards your mind and body so it appears as empty as the void itself. For the duration you are immune to psychic damage and the charmed condition, your thoughts are unreadable by any means, and your location can not be divined.  
Once activated the circlet can not activate again until the next dawn.
