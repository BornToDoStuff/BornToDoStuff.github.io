This foot long ruler has reddish-purple markings on its transparent surface, marking common intervals. When you hold it at armâ€™s length in front of an object the markings begin flashing and changing their frequency in front of your eyes until they come to rest at their new measurements. When you do this you know the precise height or width of the object you are trying to measure, even if it is extremely far away.

If you try to measure any object that is farther away than 10 miles, the markings will never settle, and begin flashing arcane markings you are unable to interpret.
