This charm has 1d6+2 eyes affixed to its fleshy surface and if you watch them long enough you will see one occasionally dart back and forth.  
As an action you can crush an eye on the charm to cast <magic-spell>True Seeing</magic-spell> on yourself, ignoring components.  
When all 6 eyes are crushed the charm lets out a shriek before shriveling into a husk.
