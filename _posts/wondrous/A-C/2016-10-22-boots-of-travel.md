These calf-high metal boots are heavily reinforced and each have two crystal orbs in their soles. While wearing them as a bonus action you can utter the command word inscribed in gnomish on the sole of the right boot, expending a charge to activate the boots. Until the end of your turn you can fly in any direction you choose, up to twice your remaining movement speed. When your turn ends if you are still flying you descend at a rate of 60 feet per round.
These boots have 3 charges, and regain one charge each day at dawn.
