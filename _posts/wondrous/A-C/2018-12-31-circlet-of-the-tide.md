This crystal circlet is a deep aqua crested with white and in its center is set a gold symbol.  
When you attune to this item 6 spheres of water, each 3 feet across, manifest as if drawing the water from the air itself before shrinking to the size of a fist and orbiting your head.  
This item has 6 charges, represented by the orbs of water, and regains all expended charges at dawn.

If you are not a caster all magical effects of this item use your Wisdom as your spellcasting ability. While you are attuned to this item you are able to breathe underwater as if it was dry land and have a swimming speed equal to your movement speed.

### Ebb and Flow
While attuned to this item you know the cantrip <magic-spell>Shape Water</magic-spell> if you did not already. When you cast this cantrip you can choose to cast it again as a free action. Additionally, you can have up to 4 of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time.

### Tides of Battle
As an action you can expend a charge to fire a sphere of water at the ground. When it strikes the ground a wave of water splashes out in an area up to 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 4d8 Bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t knocked prone. The water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames within its area and within 30 feet of it.

### Sphere of Influence
As an Attack action if you still have at least one charge remaining you may make a ranged spell attack against a target you can see within 30 feet. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the attack action this replaces one of them. When you do so one of the spheres of water orbiting you suddenly expands and flies towards the target before returning to its previous place and size. On a hit you deal 3d8 magical Bludgeoning damage.
