This large silver ring is nearly 3 feet in diameter, several inches tall and delicately thin. Along its length is a groove, and at the front it is notched through to the groove where an extravagantly large diamond is set.

When you attune with this item the groove and diamond begin to glow a soft white, and it floats of its own accord to just a foot over your head, remaining there as closely as possible. While attuned to this halo you are resistant to Radiant damage and have advantage on Religion checks.

### Heaven's Wrath
While the halo floats above your head you can call on a sliver of the might contained in the armories of the Upper Planes. As an action you can raise your hand to the sky, pulling down 1d6 shining translucent swords. They fly to your side with a flourish, and will slowly orbit you, hilt upwards, for the next minute or until they shatter.

You can have up to 6 swords orbiting you, and while at least one sword orbits you you can make a melee spell attack against any creature you can see within 60 feet of you as an Attack action. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.  
On a hit you deal 1d8 + your Intelligence(Religion) modifier Radiant damage as the sword seems to pass right through the creature. On a miss the sword shatters.

If you are not a spellcaster you use your Intelligence modifier as your spellcasting modifier for this feature.

### Angelic Properties
The halo will float above your head even in an antimagic field, despite the rest of its effects being nullified. Additionally, if you are ever separated from the halo you can summon it back to you as a bonus action unless it is blocked by an antimagic field or a ward against magical travel such as <magic-spell>Forbiddance</magic-spell>.

<div class="curse">
**Curse.** If you are ever more than 15 feet from the halo you take 1 psychic damage each minute and head inexplicably aches. If you are on a different plane from the halo you are also Blinded until you are once again on the same plane.

The only way to unattune from the halo apart from <magic-spell>Wish</magic-spell> or act of a deity is to commit a horribly evil act. If you unattune from the halo in this way the previously white light coming from it glows a dark red, and the silver dulls. The blackened halo falls to the ground, all magic properties lost and its diamond cracked. If you have proficiency with Religion you lose your proficiency in it and take 4d10 psychic damage as the knowledge is sloughed from your memory.
