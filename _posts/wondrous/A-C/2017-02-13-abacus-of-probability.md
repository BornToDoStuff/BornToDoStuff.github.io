This wooden abacus has fortune telling symbols painted across its beads. It sometimes seems to have a mind of its own, and it will lock up for a brief moment before the beads spin then stop with several symbols facing upwards before moving as normal again. Once per short rest as an action you can ask the abacus what the chance of an action happening is.

You can ask it about a course of action or the chance of death for one creature you can see.

When you ask it about an action you are about to take the abacus casts Augury, ignoring components and casting time, revealing the answer it uncovers with the symbols on the beads. When Augury is cast in this way there is no cumulative chance to get a random reading.

When you ask it about the chance of death the beads begin roiling and rapidly moving back and forth, revealing a number of skull symbols. Roll a d100 and the creature you asked the abacus about takes psychic damage equal to 50 less than the result of the roll. If this is a negative number they take no damage.
