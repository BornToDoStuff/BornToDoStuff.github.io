This simple crown made of ice, enchanted to never thaw or crack, is set with rough diamonds and sapphires. This item has 3 charges and regains 1 expended charge each day at dawn.  
While attuned to this crown you know the cantrip <magic-spell>Frostbite</magic-spell> if you did not before, which you can cast as a bonus action; You are also able to cast <magic-spell>Armor of Agathys</magic-spell>Â at will, without expending a spell slot. Additionally, as an action you can expend a charge to cast <magic-spell>Freezing Sphere</magic-spell>, <magic-spell>Investiture of Ice</magic-spell>, or <magic-spell>Wall of Ice</magic-spell>, ignoring material components. If you are not a spellcaster you use your Constitution as your spellcasting ability for this item.
