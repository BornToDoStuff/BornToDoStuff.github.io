This set of five identical compasses are lacking the distinctive cardinal direction markers you might be expecting, and you also note they each have four pointers, rather than one.  
So long as these compasses are on the same plane of existence as each other they will always point to each other. If a compass is on another plane any corresponding pointer will begin spinning in circles until the compass it points to is again on the same plane.
