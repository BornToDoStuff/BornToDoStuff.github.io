This delicate pink flower is carefully preserved with magic and will not wilt or break yet preserves its natural beauty.

While you are visibly wearing this flower you are blessed by Eldath, the goddess of peace and protection. This flower holds up to 10 charges and regains 1 charge each long rest.
As an action once per long rest you can call on the blessing of Eldath to cast the spell <magic-item>Sanctuary</magic-item> on all creatures within 30 feet of you, including yourself. This blessing does not affect any creatures in combat or with their weapons drawn, but lasts until they make an attack or cast a spell that affects an enemy creature or until their next long rest.

Additionally, you may activate the Blossom by making a prayer to Eldath. When activated the center of the blossom glows with a faint yellow and pink. For the next hour you may cast any of the following spells as an action and ignoring component costs, expending a number of charges depending on the spell cast. While activated you can also cast <magic-item>Speak with Plants</magic-item> as a ritual that has a casting time of 1 minute without expending any charges.
Your casting ability while using this item is 15 unless your class casting ability is higher.

**1 Charge.** <magic-item>Locate Animals or Plants</magic-item>, <magic-item>Entangle</magic-item>
**2 Charges.** <magic-item>Plant Growth</magic-item>, <magic-item>Greater Restoration</magic-item> (can not end or remove curse)
**4 Charges.** <magic-item>Plant Growth</magic-item> (as if cast for 8 hours), <magic-item>Wall of Thorns</magic-item> (if no creatures are within its area when cast)
