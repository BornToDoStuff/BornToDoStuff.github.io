This flute has been crafted from one of the most gnarled pieces of wood you have ever seen, but its sound is clear and pure. Inside this flute you find several rolled up sheets of parchment with a song written on it. If you are within 30 feet of a Huge or larger plant with no intelligence you can play this ancient song to shape the plants around you.  
The song takes 10 minutes and as you play it the plant life, in particular the Huge or larger plant, slowly grows, creeps, and bends to form a small shelter. This shelter is connected to or even within the plant, and is created in a form of your choosing. This shelter can be up to 10 feet tall, has an area of up to 100 square feet, and when you create it you can choose some basic things to be created within the area such as beds, chairs, platforms, shelves, and doors. 
Once you play this song you can not shape plants with it again until 2d4 days have passed and the changes you make with it remain permanently unless you use this item to return them to how they were. If there is already a shelter created in this way within range you can instead choose to expand it by the same 100 square feet. This can be done up to 5 times per Huge tree, and 5 additional times for every size above Huge.
