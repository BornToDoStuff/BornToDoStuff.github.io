This simple collared robe is fastened with silver clasps and appears unassuming until you touch it's surface. When touched it ripples with mesmerizing colors.    
This item has 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges each day at dawn.

While wearing this robe when a creature within 60 feet that can see you makes an attack against you as a reaction you can expend a charge to force that creature to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure they are charmed for the next minute. while charmed by this effect, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0. This effect ends if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its trance.

Additionally, as an action, you can expend a charge to change the robe to any color, style, or design, you want. This change is more than an illusion and physically transforms the cloak in a cascade of brilliant light before your eyes.
