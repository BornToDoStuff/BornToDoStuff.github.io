This round brazier is carved from a chunk of dark petrified wood. It has hundreds of small holes bored into it which resembles a starry night sky when lit. Any fire that burns within this brazier blazes blue and white instead of the usual yellows and reds.  
If you set up and light this brazier darkness falls over the land at the next dusk. Once activated the sun appears to never rise within a 25 mile radius of this brazier, and any light sources within this radius only produce dim light. If a creature enters this radius during the day the sun appears to set for them over the course of 10 minutes.  
This effect lasts until the sunrise after this brazier is put out or moved, and cannot be dispelled by a light spell.
