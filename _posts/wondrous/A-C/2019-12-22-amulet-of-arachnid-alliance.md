This amulet is made from delicate strands of silver wrapped around an amethyst to form the likeness of a spider. This amulet has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 expended charges after a long rest.  
While attuned to this amulet you are able to convey basic commands and feelings to spiders and spider-like creatures. Creatures you are able to communicate with in this way will not attack you unless you attack them first, and as a bonus action, you can expend a charge to cast the <magic-spell>command</magic-spell> spell (save DC 18) targeting one such creature within range. If affected they will try to act in a way that is beneficial to you
