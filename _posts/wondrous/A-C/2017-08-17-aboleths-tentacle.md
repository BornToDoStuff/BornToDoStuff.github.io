This tall brass rod is etched with an abstract circular design that seems to be devoid of any pattern and has a 4 foot section of a curled, shriveled, Aboleth tentacle affixed to its top. The tentacle is a dark sickly green, and it's so tough you aren't sure you could pierce it.

While you are attuned to this tentacle you can breathe underwater and have a +5 on any Intelligence (Religion) checks, and +5 on Intelligence (History) checks to recall things about religions or gods.

### Bloody Awakening
Once per short rest as an action if you slice your hand or wrist and drip your own blood onto the tentacle as you hold the rod the tentacle rejuvenates, and expands down the rod engulfing your arm. For the next minute you can not use that arm as it is encased in a giant tentacle. However you may make melee attacks with proficiency with the tentacle. It has a reach of 10 feet and deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

After the minute is up the tentacle shrivels once again, receding back up the rod, and releasing your arm, now covered in slime. Until the next day your arm remains a pale green tint where the tentacle covered it and the cut you made to awaken the tentacle refuses to fully close, even in response to magical healing.

### Aboleth's Eye
While the tentacle is engulfing your arm you may use an action to focus your gaze and force all creatures in a 30 foot cone to make a Wisdom saving throw DC 14 or take 1d6 psychic damage.
