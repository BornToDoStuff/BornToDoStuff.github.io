This marble bust weighs 4 pounds and depicts a heavily bearded man in a philosophical pose rumored to be Mordenkainen. Its base is covered in runes and appears to be well worn.

While you are holding this bust you can use it as an arcane focus. When you use this item as an arcane focus you gain the following benefits.

<!--excerpt-->
### Artist's Flair.
When you cast a spell you can create one minor visual effect as if with the cantrip <magic-spell>Prestidigitation</magic-spell> or make a visual change to the spell such as adding a color, changing its color, or making it appear to take on a shape.

### Advanced Spell Sculpting.
When you cast a Conjuration, Evocation, or Necromancy spell, you are able to create pockets of relative safety.
If the duration of the spell is instantaneous you can choose a number of creatures you can see equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would otherwise take half damage on a successful save.

if the duration of the spell is not instantaneous you can choose a spherical or conical area up to half of the total spell’s area that is not affected. As an action on any of your following turns you can change the area of the spell affected if it is still active. However, the spell can never affect less than half its area or leave the area it would otherwise occupy if it was unaltered.
