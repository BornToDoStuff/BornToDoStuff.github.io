This metallic cylinder is about the length of a man's hand, it has a spike on one end and a button on the other.
As an action you can press the button and throw the blast shield up to 30 feet. Or if you are holding the blast shield you can throw the blast shield at your feet as a reaction to any attack or effect that includes you or an adjacent creature.
As soon as the spike makes contact it creates a 15 foot sphere, centered on the blast shield, equivalent to Otiluke's Resilient Sphere that lasts until the end of your next turn.
Once the blast shield has been used in this way it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
