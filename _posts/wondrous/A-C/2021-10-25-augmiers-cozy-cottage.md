This large 1-foot diameter orb holds a diorama of a wattle and daub cottage in the woods. This diorama changes with the seasons and is intricately detailed.   
In the diorama you can see a gnomish word chiseled into the side of the cottage. If you speak this command word while holding the orb and standing on a reasonably flat area with at least a 20-foot cube of space you suddenly find yourself inside the cottage. The cottage instantly transports from the orb into the space you are standing, and any creatures in the space the cottage now occupies are placed in a free space within the cottage if they fit, or outside if they do not.  
This 20-foot square cottage is furnished with 3 bunk beds, a large table with 6 chairs, a fireplace, and several empty bookshelves and chests along the wall.  
If you speak the command word again while touching both the cottage and orb, the cottage and any objects in the shelves or chests return to the orb. Any creatures in the cottage remain where they were.  
The cottage can only be taken from and returned to the orb once per day.
