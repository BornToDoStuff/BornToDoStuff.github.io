This small wooden barrel is made of polished oak and is wrapped with brass bands. It looks like it would hold about 5 gallons but when you pour liquids into this barrel it seems to never overflow. It can hold 200 up to gallons, though it will never weigh more than 50 pounds, regardless of how much is in it. If you attempt to store anything except a liquid in the barrel it will only hold 1 cubic foot of material.
If you leave it sealed for an entire month, no matter what liquid was poured into the barrel it will be a stout ale of the same volume when poured out.  
Placing this barrel inside an extradimensional space created by aÂ _portable hole_, or similar item instantly destroys both items in a massive explosion of ale and light. Any creature within 10 feet of the barrel when it explodes becomes completely drunk and is Poisoned for a number of hours equal to 10 minus their Constitution modifier, even if they would otherwise be immune to poison.
