This silvery sword has a razor thin yet broad blade that glints yellow in the sun. It’s hand-and-a-half hilt is coated with gold and has an exorbitantly large diamond as the pommel.

### Undead Bane
This sword deals Radiant damage instead of Slashing damage to any undead creature. Additionally, when you take the Dodge action until the beginning of your next turn any undead that makes a melee attack against you automatically fails as the sword flashes with a golden light.

### Heaven’s Fury
While wielding this sword you can command a portion of the armories of the Upper Planes. Once per day as an action you can swing the sword down, pointing at a point you can see within 300 feet. When you do so a crack like thunder can be heard as a hail of massive 20 foot swords, almost identical to your own, crash into the ground in a 30 foot radius around the point you chose. These swords fly from the heavens, even piercing through trees and roofs in their path.

Any creature in the area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. If you are proficient in Religion you add your proficiency to this DC. On a failure the creature takes 3d12 Piercing damage and 3d12 Radiant damage. Celestial creatures automatically succeed this saving throw.

### Angelic Properties
This sword is immune to rusting can not be shattered. As a bonus action if you have a free hand you can summon this sword to you unless it is blocked by an antimagic field or a ward against magical travel such as <magic-spell>Forbiddance</magic-spell>.

<div id="curse">
**Curse.** If you knowingly attack an innocent creature the sword will immediately streak with dark gray, lose all magic ability, and its diamond will shatter. Additionally, you take 1 fire damage as a symbol is branded into your forehead.  
If you unattune with this sword it will begin floating, before, with a clap like thunder, it soars into the sky and returns to the Upper Planes.
