This silvered sword has a broad blade that glints yellow in the sun. It’s golden hand-and-a-half hilt has an exorbitantly large diamond as the pommel.

### Undead's Bane
This sword deals Radiant damage instead of Slashing damage to any undead creature. Additionally, when you take the Dodge action until the beginning of your next turn you have resistance to Necrotic damage. 

### Heaven’s Fury
While wielding this sword you can command a fraction of the might contained in the armories of the Upper Planes. Once per day as an action you can swing the sword down at point you can see. When you do so a crack like thunder can be heard as a hail of massive 20 foot swords crash into the ground in a 30 foot radius around the point you chose. These swords fly from the heavens, piercing through almost any object in their path before disappearing in a flash.

Any creature in the area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. If you are proficient in Religion you add your proficiency to this DC. On a failure the creature takes 3d12 Piercing damage and 3d12 Radiant damage. Celestial creatures automatically succeed this saving throw.

### Angelic Properties
This sword can not rust or shatter, and you can summon this sword to you as a bonus action if you have a free hand unless it is blocked by an antimagic field or a ward against magical travel such as <magic-spell>Forbiddance</magic-spell>.

<div class="curse">
**Curse.** If you knowingly attack an innocent creature the sword will immediately streak with black, lose all magic ability, and its diamond will shatter. Additionally, you take 1 fire damage as a symbol is branded into your forehead.  
If you unattune with this sword it will begin floating, before, with a clap like thunder, it soars into the sky and returns to the Upper Planes.
