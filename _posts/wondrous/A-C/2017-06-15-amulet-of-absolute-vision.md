This amulet is a single large turquoise set in silver. It doesn't have a chain but it has a hole where it would usually hang from one.

While you are attuned to this amulet the area within 5 feet of the stone is never obscured unless you are blinded. When in any effect that is more than lightly obscuring, a pale blue-green light, that is visible only to you, radiates out to 5 feet from the amulet. This light does not destroy magical darkness but you are able to clearly see within its radius regardless.

Additionally, Whenever any Invisible creature is within 120 feet the amulet faintly pulsates. If the Invisible creature is within 5 feet of the amulet they are bathed in the pale blue-green light. When a creature is in this light they do not gain any of the benefits of Invisibility against you.
