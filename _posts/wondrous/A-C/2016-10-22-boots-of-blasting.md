These heavy metal boots weigh 5 pounds together and appear to be heavily charred.
As a bonus action once per short rest you can stomp your foot and either rocket 10 feet into the air and 20 feet in any direction you choose, or 25 feet into the air and 5 feet in any direction you choose, dealing 1d6 force damage to you and all creatures within 5 feet in the explosion. When moving in this fashion using the boots you do not incur opportunity attacks.  
These boots do not negate fall damage that might be incurred from their use however while wearing the boots of blasting you cannot be knocked prone by falling
