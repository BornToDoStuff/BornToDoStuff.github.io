This small fired clay orb has an intricate network of bored holes through it.Â   
This item has 10 charges and regains 1 expended charge each day at dawn.  
As an action you can touch this orb to a surface made of wood or clay and expend a number of charges. A number of cubic feet of material is destroyed equal to the number of charges expended as the area is swarmed with phantom termites. The material removed can be in any shape, so long as it is contiguous, and not overly complex.
