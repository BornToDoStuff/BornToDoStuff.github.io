This black cloak has a hint of blue with silvered threads dashing through it. When in motion it appears as if the threads are electrical energy crackling off the fabric. Inside the hood a silver insignia of Talos has been carefully stitched. 
This cloak has 12 charges and regains all charges at dawn.  

While wearing this cloak you know the cantrip <magic-spell>Gust</magic-spell> if you did not already and can cast it as a bonus action.

### Winds of Change
As an action you can expend a number of charges to create a vortex of howling winds. When you do so choose one 5 foot space within 120 feet for each charge. Large or smaller creatures within 15 feet of a target space, but not in a target space, must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet directly away from the nearest targeted space.

### Energizing Presence
All allies, including yourself, within 10 feet are affected by the energy pulsing around you and have a +5 bonus to initiative.  
Additionally, as a reaction you can expend a charge to grant one creature you can see advantage on Dexterity or Strength saving throws until the end of their next turn.

### Lightning Mastery
When you cast a spell that deals Lightning damage the air around you tingles with energy. You may choose a number of enemy creatures up to the level of the spell slot expended within 30 feet of you. Each target creature takes 1d4+1 Lightning damage as tendrils of electricity reach out from your robe.
