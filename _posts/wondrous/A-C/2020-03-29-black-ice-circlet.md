This rough circlet chiseled from black ice has a single onyx set in its face and glistens a cold blue in the light. While you are attuned to this circlet you automatically succeed on saving throws against effects that would deal Necrotic damage and are resistant to psychic damage. Additionally, you know the cantrip <magic-spell>Chill Touch</magic-spell> if you did not before, which you can cast as a bonus action. If you are not a spellcaster you use your Charisma as your spellcasting ability for this item.  
<div class="curse">
**Curse.** If you die while attuned with this circlet you rise 24 hours later as a corrupted version of your former self unless you are restored to life or your body is destroyed. This curse can only be removed while surrounded by Black Ice or by <magic-spell>Wish</magic-spell>.
