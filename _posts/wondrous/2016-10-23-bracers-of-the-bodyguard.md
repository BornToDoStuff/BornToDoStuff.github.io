These leather bracers each have several metal bands running down the forearm and chains wrap around their wrists.
When you cast Shield, Shield of Faith, or Sanctuary, you may target an additional creature. Shield can be cast to a range of 15 feet and may be triggered by a creature within range being attacked or targeted by the spell Magic Missile.
Each time the bracers are used in this way the chains glow brightly.
