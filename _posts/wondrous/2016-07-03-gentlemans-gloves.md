These white leather gloves are always the perfect fit. A true gentleman never dirties his hands, and these gloves will attune to the wearer as soon as they do something that would have otherwise dirtied their hands with the gloves on.
They say beware a gentle man that goes to war. While wearing the gloves if you are above half hit points you cannot take a bonus action, but you can accomplish anything that would normally be a bonus action as an action. However when you drop below half health you are able to take two bonus actions per turn.
