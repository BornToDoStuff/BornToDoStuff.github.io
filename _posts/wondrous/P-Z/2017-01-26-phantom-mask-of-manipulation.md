This face mask is pure white with pewter trim around its edges. It is sculpted into what could be called a bird head with an unusually short beak, also covered in pewter, but with delicate filigree.

### Hand in the Shadows
As a bonus action if there is dim light anywhere within 60 feet of you you can manipulate it into a shape of your choosing. This shape can not be larger than 10 feet on any side, and has no substance. You can create this shape anywhere within 60 feet of you that you can see, but do not need to maintain sight with it.
Additionally, as an action you can manipulate a shape you have created to move as long as it remains within range. This shape remains until you use this effect again, it is exposed to magical light, or you move out of range.

### Phantom Puppeteer
While wearing this mask you can use it as a spellcasting focus to cast spells from the school of Enchantment. When you do so, you can feel a new force.Your face tingles slightly and certain spells are stronger than they were before. When you cast the spell <magic-spell>Charm Person</magic-spell>, <magic-spell>Calm Emotions</magic-spell>, or <magic-spell>Enthrall</magic-spell> against a single target the target creature has disadvantage on their saving throw. Additionally, when you cast the spell <magic-spell>Sleep</magic-spell> you may roll an additional 2d8 to determine how many hit points of creatures the spell can affect.
