This bag of powder is made from the bones of an immensely strong undead and it dries out your skin with even the smallest contact. As an action you can spread a handful of this powder over an adjacent square and for the next year, or until purposefully dispersed by another creature, undead with a CR of 3 or lower can not pass over or touch this space. The bag holds four handfuls of bone powder.
