Each of the bucklers from this set has two protrusions that slope to a razor sharp tip, giving it the shape of an eye. The main body of the bucklers is studded and sports a hammered finish while the spines are both polished perfectly smooth. The first spine is 1 foot long and the second is half as long.  
As you initially inspect the bucklers you can not find any way to wear them. There are no straps or handholds, simply an engraved name on the back of each buckler.

While you are are attuned to these bucklers and within 120 feet of them you can gesture or call to one or both of them as an action. When you do so they will fly to you if able, going around obstacles and creatures, before snapping into place on your forearms, long spine towards your fist. They float several inches off your arm, moving with you as if they are attached.  
They can not be moved from your arm unless you allow it. When you brush one or both of them off as a bonus action they will fall to the ground.  
While wearing these bucklers you can not wield a shield but you gain +1 to your AC. Additionally, you can make melee attacks with proficiency using these bucklers as if they were a Light Finesse weapon and they deal 1d6 Piercing damage.
