This regal helmet is made of jet black granite, and trimmed with gold. Despite it’s dense materials it is not overly heavy. If you have horns the helmet gladly morphs to fit.  
While attuned to this helmet you gain the following features.

### Mountain’s Soul
You gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws and Athletics checks. You also gain fluent knowledge of the Giant and Terran languages.

### Giant’s Strength
While wearing this helmet your strength score changes to 23 unless your strength is already greater than 23, and it can not be reduced below 23 while you are wearing the helmet. Additionally, if a rock or similar object is thrown at you you can, with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, catch it and take no bludgeoning damage from it.

### Impassable Wall
As an action you can envelope creatures near you with an immense crushing presence. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature frightened in this way sees you appear to grow up to 18 feet tall, or as large as the space around you allows, and takes an additional 2d6 psychic damage each time you hit them with a melee weapon or unarmed attack. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After you use this feature you can not use it again until the end of a long or short rest.
