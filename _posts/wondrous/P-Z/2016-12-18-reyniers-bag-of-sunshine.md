This small black velvet bag is tightly tied off with a suede strap. It is equivalent to a pouch and can hold the same amount of weight and volume. The first time this bag is opened each day a ray of light streams from the opening in a 15 foot cone. All creatures in this cone must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn. This beam of light counts as a third level light spell for dispelling darkness.

While the bag is open it emits dim light out to 15 feet.
