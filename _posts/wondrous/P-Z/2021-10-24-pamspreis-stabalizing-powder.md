This pouch of coarse yellow powder smells almost sickly sweet but has no noticeable taste. When dissolved into a liquid it keeps it from souring or going bad for an additional 3 days the first time it is added, but its effects are removed by <magic-spell>Purify Food And Drink</magic-spell>.  
This pouch contains enough for up to 10 gallons of liquid.
