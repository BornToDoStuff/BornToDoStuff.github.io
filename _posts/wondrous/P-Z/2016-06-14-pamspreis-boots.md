These calf-length leather boots are slick to the touch and have a light sheen to them. Strangely they never get stuck in the mud or get dirty, everything seems to roll right off of them. While wearing them you have advantage to escape any effect or object that would normally trap your feet and additionally difficult terrain involving mud, or other sticky substances, does not affect you. Be careful while walking on ice though.
