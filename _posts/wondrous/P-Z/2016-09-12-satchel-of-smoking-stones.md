This is a simple leather satchel riddled with scorch marks and tiny holes. When opened it has nothing insde it, but if you reach in without looking you can feel several stones or orbs.  
It has 4 charges and regains all expended charges each day at dawn.

As a bonus action you can expend a charge and pull out a fist sized stone that begins to smoke. At the end of your next turn it will shatter with a low crack that can be heard out to 100 feet. It explodes into shards dealing 1d10 piercing damage to all creatures within 5 feet that are not behind 3/4 or full cover. You can throw one of these smoking stones up to 30 feet.

<div class="curse">
If the satchel is exposed to fire damage a charge is expended and a stone shatters. Additionally, any stone exposed to fire damage immediately shatters.
