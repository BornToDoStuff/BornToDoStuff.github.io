This dirty bag has 2d4+2 stained bone talismans inside it that give you an uneasy feeling if you have the bag open for too long.  
Whenever you hold one of these talismans as an action you can make a DC 12 Intelligence(Arcana) check to attempt to concentrate on it.Â  On a success you are able to see through all of the talismans, except the one you are holding, as if you were there, until you choose to stop, but can not see through your own eyes while doing so.  
Curse. If there are too many talismans that are not covered or wrapped (such as in a bag or a cloth) you are overwhelmed by all the things you can see when you use one. You can safely view up to your spellcasting modifier, or your Constitution modifier if you are not a spellcaster. If the number of uncovered talismans is greater than this modifier, you take 1d10 psychic damage that can not be resisted or reduced in any way and 1 additional psychic damage for every uncovered talisman above your modifier. If this effect reduces you to 0 hit points you are transported to the plane of Pandemonium (or Xoriat).
