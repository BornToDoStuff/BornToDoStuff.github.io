This crown is the same hue as solid gold, though slightly translucent and doesnt weigh as much as you might expect it to. It is encrusted in yellow gemstones and glistens with every movement.
It has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 charges each day at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a swarm of bees appears, and consumes and destroys the crown before dispersing.

While wearing the crown, as an action you can expend a number of charges to create one of the following effects.    
**1 charge**, you cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a 15-foot radius around you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, until you disperse it, or a wind of at least 10 miles an hour disperses it. This area is heavily obscured for all creatures besides you.  
**4 charges**, you cast <magic-spell>Giant Insect</magic-spell> targeting up to 5 bees or wasps within 120 feet of you.   
**5 charges**, you cast <magic-spell>Insect Plague</magic-spell> at 5th level, and the area you choose is filled with swarming stinging bees. If you are not a spellcaster this uses your Charisma modifier as your spellcasting ability.
