This simple red cylinder marked with a sun rune is named for the intense light it creates. You can light it as an action, and when lit it will fly into the sky before exploding in a flash, illuminating the landscape. For the next 10 minutes bright light is cast in a 100-foot-radius, 200-foot-high cylinder, and dim light for an additional 100 feet. This light is sunlight and dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell. Any oozes, undead, or fiends within this light have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws. Additionally, any fiend that starts their turn within the area of bright light takes 1d12 radiant damage.
