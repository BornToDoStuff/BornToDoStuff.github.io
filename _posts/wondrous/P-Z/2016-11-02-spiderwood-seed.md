To attune to this black grape-size seed you must swallow it. Over the course of 1 week a series of wooden growths protrude from your back along your spine. Several of these grow into four limber wooden appendages.
As an attack action you can make a melee attack with one of these limbs as if you are proficient, using either your Strength or Dexterity modifier. On a hit it deals 2d6 plus either your Strength or Dexterity modifier Piercing damage. This damage counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
These limbs automatically regrow 1 minute after being seriously damaged or removed, and are each able to hold objects weighing up to 30 pounds. Additionally, you have a climbing speed equal to half your walking speed and are able to move your full speed while prone as long as these legs are free.

<!--excerpt-->
<div id="curse">
**Curse.** Once swallowed the seed begins to grow, causing great pain in your upper back. For the next week you suffer 1 level of exhaustion which can not be removed even with <magic-spell>Greater Restoration.</magic-spell> This seed feeds on your life force in exchange for submitting to your control. Up to 4 hit dice are automatically consumed each day at dawn. Additionally, a hit dice is consumed for each limb  that regrows or repairs major damage to itself. If there are no remaining hit dice when a limb repairs itself you take 1d8 necrotic damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.
If the curse is removed from this item the appendages slowly shrivel, die, and fall off. The attunement is broken, but the wooden knobs on your back remain.
