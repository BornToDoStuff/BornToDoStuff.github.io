This glass amulet is not polished as a glass bottle would be but is instead appears unfinished and crude. Beneath the rough surface you can see the flickering of a blazing fire and feel its warmth against your skin.  
This amulet has 5 charges and regains all expended charges at dawn.  

While wearing this amulet you have resistance to Cold damage and are not affected by extreme cold conditions. Additionally, you are immune to any magical fire that you create.

### Undying Flames
While attuned to this amulet you know the <magic-spell>Create Bonfire</magic-spell> and <magic-spell>Control Flames</magic-spell> cantrips if you did not already. This feature uses your Constitution score as your casting ability if you are not a spellcaster.  
You can cast these cantrips as bonus actions, they do not require concentration, and their duration is considered indefinite. They last until you dispel them, you fall unconscious, or you cast them again.

### Searing Aura
As a bonus action you can expend a charge to call upon the flames within the amulet and the air around you begins to shimmer with a sweltering heat. For the next minute any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes 1d8 Fire damage.

### Immolating Burst
As an action you can reach out your hand and expend a charge to cause a fiery outburst. The flames within the amulet pulse and a line of fire 5 feet wide and 30 feet long flares from your palm. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.Â This feature uses your Constitution score as your casting ability if you are not a spellcaster.
