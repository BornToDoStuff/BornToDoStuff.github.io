This pendant is a garnet set into a wide bronze base devoid of any marking. It is warm to the touch and hangs from a similarly plain bronze chain. This pendant has 8 charges, and regains 2d4 expended charges each dawn.

As a bonus action you can activate the Pendant and it will softly flicker. Until the beginning of your next turn any time a creature you can see within 15 feet of you, including yourself, is hit by a ranged weapon attack you can choose to expend a charge to reduce the damage of the attack by 1d8 + your Dexterity modifier by blasting the missile with a searing bolt of flame from the pendant. If you reduce the damage of a missile to 0 it burns to ash before it reaches the target creature.
