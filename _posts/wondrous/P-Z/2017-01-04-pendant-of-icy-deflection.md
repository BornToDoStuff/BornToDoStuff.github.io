This pendant is a pale blue sapphire set into a wide silver base etched with the fractal patterns of morning frost. It hangs from a thin silver chain with no magical properties. This pendant has 4 charges, and regains 1d4 expended charges each dawn.

As a bonus action you can expend 1 charge, or as a reaction to being hit by a ranged weapon attack you can expend 2 charges, to activate the Pendant. When you activate the pendant it grows bitterly cold and bolts of ice dart from its center at incoming missiles. Each time you are hit by a ranged weapon attack from a creature you can see, including the triggering attack, the damage is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier until the end of your next turn. If you reduce the damage of a missile to 0 it drops from the air at your feet, frozen in a chunk of ice.
