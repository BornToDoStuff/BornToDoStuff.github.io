This glass bottle has an inky black cloud that quickly fades to black within it and light sources flicker when placed directly next to it. When you open the vial the darkness within it erupts into a 30-foot-radius sphere of dim light that spreads around corners. This area of dim light is not considered daylight and non-magical light canâ€™t illuminate it. It lasts for 10 minutes, or until dispelled by a 3rd level spell or greater.  
Creatures that start their turn in the radius must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be Blinded until the beginning of their next turn. Undead and fiends automatically succeed on this saving throw.  
Once used this vial can not be used again until the next day at dawn.
