The centerpiece of this amulet is a pearlescent green emerald. An etching of a leaf can faintly be seen in the sheen of its surface and the gem is framed by delicate silver branches. This item has 4 charges and regains 1d4 charges each day at dawn. While attuned to this amulet you know the cantrip <magic-spell>Gust</magic-spell>Â if you did not previously. As a bonus action you can focus on a number of leaves up to your casting ability modifier (minimum 1) that you can touch. When you do so the leaves become hard as iron and can be treated as darts for the next minute. Additionally, as an action you can expend a charge to cast <magic-spell>Gust of Wind</magic-spell>. If you are in a forested area or an area with many trees the leaves around you begin to pick up speed as they fly through the wind like knives and any creature that makes a save against this effect takes 3d8 slashing damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. If you are not a caster your casting ability for this item is Wisdom.
