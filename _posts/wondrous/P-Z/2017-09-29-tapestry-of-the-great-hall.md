This large forest green tapestry has a symbol stretching across its length switched in gilded thread. Its accented with white and red and all along its hem is a complicated mantra of magical symbols and signs.

To attune to it a creature must be touching the tapestry for at least 1 minute of the hour attunement and for the rest of the duration must study and memorize the symbol depicted on it. This item can be attuned to by any number of creatures but the creatures must renew their attunement each year.

Even when attuned, a creature can not know the tapestry's abilities unless they are told by another creature, if they successfully decode the mantra around its edges, or if they cast <magic-spell>Identify</magic-spell> on it. If <magic-spell>Identify</magic-spell> is cast on the tapestry the caster must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure they forget all the abilities of the tapestry and are stunned for 1 hour as they become lost in its intricate threads. On a success they only discern a single ability and must cast <magic-spell>Identify</magic-spell> again to find any more. They learn these abilities in order as they are written.

If there are more than 6 creatures attuned to the tapestry the symbols emblazoned around its edge begin to slowly glow and its abilities are activated.

### Shared Link
While attuned to the tapestry a creature can communicate with any other attuned creature even if they do not share a common language. Additionally, the cantrip Message can be used between attuned creatures regardless of distance as long as they are on the same plane as each other.

### Recall Beacon
Any creature that is attuned to the tapestry can teleport to an empty space within 60 feet of it, as long as it is on the same plane of existence, by picturing the symbol on it in their mind and maintaining concentration as if concentrating on a spell for 1 minute. After a creature uses this feature they are unable to use it again for 1d4 days.

### Ring of Detection
Any creature attuned to the tapestry can on focus on the symbol on the tapestry as if concentrating on a spell. While concentrating like this they can find the location of any creature that is attuned to the tapestry and within 10 miles by speaking their name. Additionally, they can sense if there are any creatures that are not attuned and within 1000 feet but do not know their location.

### Emergency Recall
If a creature who is attuned to the tapestry spends 1 hour casting a ritual while focusing on the symbol on the tapestry they are able to forcefully recall all attuned creatures. All creatures not within sight of the tapestry and within the same plane are teleported to an empty space within sight of the tapestry. If there are no more empty spaces the creatures that did not fit are not teleported. This feature can even recall the bodies of creatures (or what is left of them) if the soul is willing to be recalled, attuned to the tapestry within the last year, and was still attuned to the tapestry at the time of death. Once used this feature cannot be used again for 1d4 months.
