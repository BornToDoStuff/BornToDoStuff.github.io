These two strings of polished silver bells tinkle merrily when shaken and can be heard up to 120 feet away. These bells have 4 charges, and regain one expended charge each time you use the Dash action while wearing them. Also, while wearing these bells your movement speed and jump distance increases by 5 feet.

Any ally creature that can hear these bells can choose to expend a charge to roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an ability check or attack roll of its choice. It can make this choice before or after making the initial roll. Once a creature has used this feature it can not do so again until its next turn.
