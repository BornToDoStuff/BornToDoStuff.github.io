This black hooded cape has a mantle of iridescent raven feathers on its shoulders and is trimmed with a similarly iridescent ribbon. This item has 4 charges and regains 1 expended charge each day at sunset, or 1 charge for each raven sacrificed.

As an action you can expend a charge to activate the cloak and a billowing plume of phantom ravens erupts from the mantle. The ravens spread into a 60-foot radius sphere centered on you and move with you for the next minute before disappearing. This area is considered lightly obscured and spreads around corners.

While these ravens surround you, you gain the following benefits:  
You always know how many small or larger creatures are within the cloud of ravens, but not what creatures, or where they are.  
Additionally, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity.Â   
Finally, as an action you can command these ravens to attack a creature within the radius. The target creature must make a Wisdom saving throw DC 14. On a failure they take 4d4 Psychic damage and are Blinded until the beginning of their next turn. On a success they take half as much damage and are not Blinded.
