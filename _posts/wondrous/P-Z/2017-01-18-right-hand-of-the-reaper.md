This glove has a cuff that extends down the length of your forearm and is stitched from a dark-brown supple leather. The tips and pads of its fingers as well as the palm are reinforced with black leather. It has a short silver claw extending out from the tip of the thumb and small silver plates covering the back of each finger. To attune to this item you must wear it for the duration.

This item has 25 charges, and if you have a positive Wisdom modifier it gains an additional number of charges equal to your Wisdom modifier times 5. It regains all expended charges after a long rest.
When you make a successful unarmed attack with this glove you can expend a number of charges to deal that much additional Necrotic damage.

### Skilled Harvester
When you wield a Sickle it deals 1d6 slashing damage, has the property Finesse, and when you wield it with two hands it deals an additional 1d6 Necrotic damage.

### Hand of Repose
While attuned to this glove you know the cantrip <magic-spell>Mage Hand</magic-spell> if you did not before. Additionally, when you cast <magic-spell>Mage Hand</magic-spell> it is completely invisible to all except you, and appears as a skeletal hand; It can carry up to 20 pounds and has no duration, lasting until you dismiss it as an action or cast <magic-spell>Mage Hand</magic-spell> again.

<div class="curse">
**Curse.** The moment you finish attuning to this glove the arm you are wearing it on is wracked with pain. You take 1d12 Necrotic damage and your vision extends out into the Ethereal plane despite your body remaining in the mortal plane. You hear whispers around you growing ever closer until your senses return to your body and you become aware of how light your arm is.

While the glove is covering your arm you cant notice any difference, but when you take off the glove you can see that your arm stops in a withered stump. Your arm and hand are gone. When the glove is "worn" where your arm once was you can "use your hand" as normal, but it is incorporeal otherwise.

If you have the feature Lay on Hands whenever you use it you make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8). On a failure your pools of energy conflict and you must roll 1d10, expending that many charges and dealing that much Necrotic damage to the target creature.

If you dispel the curse on this item it is destroyed and your arm does not return.
