This glove has a cuff that extends down the length of your forearm and is stitched from a dark-brown yet supple leather. The tips and pads of its fingers as well as the palm are reinforced with a thin black leather. It has a very short silver claw extending out from the tip of the thumb that covers the first knuckle as well as small silver plates covering the back of each finger. To attune to this item you must wear it when you are attuning.

While attuned to this glove you gain a pool of arcane energy that replenishes when you take a long rest. You have 25 points in this pool. If your wisdom modifier is positive you gain a bonus to this pool equal to your Wisdom modifier x 5.
As an action, you can make an unarmed attack against a creature within 5 feet. On a hit you can draw power from the pool to deal additional Necrotic damage to that creature equal to the number of points expended, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

### Skilled Harvester
When you wield a Sickle it now deals 1d6 slashing damage, has the property Finesse, and when you wield it with two hands it deals an additional 1d6 Necrotic damage.

### Hand of Repose
While attuned to this glove you gain the ability to cast <magic-spell>Mage Hand</magic-spell> if you could not before. Additionally, when you cast <magic-spell>Mage Hand</magic-spell> it is completely invisible to all except you, appearing to you as a skeletal hand. This variant of mage hand is unusually strong and can carry up to 20 pounds and has no duration, lasting until you dismiss it as an action.

<section id="curse">
**Curse.** The moment you finish attuning to this glove the arm you are wearing it on is wracked with pain. You take 1d12 Necrotic damage and everything around you momentarily appears as if you are in the Ethereal plane even though your body remains in the mortal plane. You hear whispers around you growing ever closer until your senses return to your body and you are now aware of how light your arm is.

While the glove is covering your arm it feels as normal, but when you lift the cuff several inches above where it is covered your arm stops in a withered stump. Your arm and hand are gone. You can push up the cuff and pass your remaining hand straight through where there should be flesh and bone and the glove will not move from your wrist, as if it is fixed in place to the nothing replacing your hand. You can still use your hand as normal, it simply has no substance beneath the glove.

If you have the feature Lay on Hands whenever you use it you must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure your pools of energy conflict. Roll a 1d10 and that many points are expended from your arcane energy pool. Additionally, subtract that number from the points you expended for lay on hands, and the creature heals that much less than expected. If this creates a negative number the creature takes that much Necrotic damage.

If you dispel the curse on this item it is destroyed and your arm does not return.
