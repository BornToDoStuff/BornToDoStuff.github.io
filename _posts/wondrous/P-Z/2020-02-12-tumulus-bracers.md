These leather bracers are reinforced with weathered bones and covered in lichen. While attuned with these bracers you know when any creature within 60 feet of you is deceased or an undead. These bracers have 5 charges and regain 1d4+1 expended charges each day at sunset.  
As an action, you can expend a charge and target a Large or smaller creatureÂ touching the ground that you can see within 120 feet. The target creature must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failure they are restrained as the earth itself heaves up around it. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.  
If you expend a charge to target a creature restrained in this way they must make another DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failure they take 4d10 bludgeoning damage and are buried alive under the earth. On a success they take half as much damage and are not buried. A buried creature is blinded, restrained, and takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage each turn, but can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. A creature who escapes from being buried is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
