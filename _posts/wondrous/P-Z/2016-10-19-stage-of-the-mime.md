This wooden chest is one foot on each side and has a simple clasped lid. The Stage of the Mime has 3 charges, and weighs 4 pounds. As an action you can open the chest, expending a charge.
When the chest is opened it becomes spectral and unfolds into a small ghostly stage on the ground, creating a 20 foot radius zone of silence, centered on the location the box was opened. This zone of silence lasts 1 minute and while within this zone of silence you have advantage to all performance checks that are not considered an attack. At the end of 1 minute the stage disappears leaving the, no longer spectral, chest in its place.
The Stage of the Mime regains 1d4-1 charges each day at dawn.
