This vehicle appears to be a hollowed out tree covered in vines and branches, still alive and growing. It has two seats facing towards the middle of the vehicle where it has a set of three wooden levers. While a creature is sitting in the walker it has half cover, can fasten themselves to the walker as a bonus action, and can control it as an action or bonus action to move up to 30 feet per round. The walker can move up walls and on ceilings, but any creature not fastened in must make a DC 14 Strength check each turn or fall out of the walker. The walker can also float, as if using the spell Water Walk and has a movement speed of 10 feet while doing so.

The walker can carry up to 400 pounds, its speed is halved if the weight exceeds this, and reduced to 0 if it exceeds 600 pounds. It needs to recharge and return to nature though. When it runs out of energy it will refuse to carry any weight and search for the nearest soil it can find to root itself in. It can remain active for up to 16 hours, after which it needs to root in soil or sand for the duration of a long rest. During this time it closes its hollow and looks just like a stout tree approximately 6 feet tall, covered in vines.

### Commune with the Circle.
If you know druidic you can verbally command the walker to move (using druidic) as long as it is in hearing range. Additionally, you can command it to root, unroot, and close its hollow. It will not close its hollow while a small or larger creature is in it but it can close its hollow with up to 200 pounds in it. For every hour it is rooted it can remain active for an additional 2 hours that day.
