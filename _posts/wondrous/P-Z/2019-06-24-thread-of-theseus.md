This ball of golden thread glimmers in the light and while you are holding it you always know which direction is north. 
If you tie this thread tightly around an object the thread becomes anchored. When you do this the knot around the anchor, and end of the thread, vanish as if dissolving into thin air. As the ball of thread moves away from the anchor it continues to unravel as if securely fastened, but after a few inches the thread fades into nothing and can not be touched and can not be seen except with Truesight. This ball of thread never runs out as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the anchor. When you quickly yank three times on the ball of thread it activates and becomes taut. When it is activated all thread within 10 feet of the ball of thread becomes visible but still can not be touched, allowing you to trace it back to the anchor, no matter how far it may be. 
This thread can only be cut with a silvered weapon or by going to another plane of existence but immediately breaks if the anchor is moved more than 5 feet after the thread is tied. If broken or cut, all unwound thread immediately disintegrates.
This thread can only be anchored to one object at a time, and after being activated, cut, or broken, can not be used again for 3d12 days.
