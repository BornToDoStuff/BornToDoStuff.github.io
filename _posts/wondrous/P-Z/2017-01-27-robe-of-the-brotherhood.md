As you pick it up you realize this simple light gray robe was obviously made for a brother who was more than just a clergyman. Underneath it is a chain shirt carefully woven into the fabric.

When you take the Help action you can expend a charge to activate the robe. When the robe is activated, up to five creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet are bathed in a soft light and gain advantage to their first attack roll or ability check before the end of their next turn. At the end of their next turn the light fades away.
This robe has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dawn.
