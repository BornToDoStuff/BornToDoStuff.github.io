This bag of coarse powder is made from the bones of an immensely strong undead, and it dries out your skin when you come into direct contact with it. As an action you can spread a handful of this powder over an adjacent square and for the next year, or until purposefully dispersed by another creature, undead with a CR of 3 or lower can not willingly come within 10 feet of the powdered space. The bag holds four handfuls of bone powder.
