This pebble appears inconspicuous on first inspection, however with a closer look you note excruciating detail, each little crevice and crack pops out. Usually 3d6+2 Tiny Boulders are found together in a small leather pouch. You can throw one of these tiny boulders 30 feet or put it in a sling. When the pebble strikes a surface or is crushed it rapidly expands into a large boulder. Each creature within a 5 foot radius must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 6d10 bludgeoning damage, half on a successful save.
