This tight-fitting purple cap is made from the hide of a mind flayer. It is often worn under helmets of wealthy or high ranking dwarves to protect against illithid attacks.  
While wearing this helmet you can not be detected by detect thoughts or similar effects, and you can choose to prevent creatures from communicating telepathically with you. Additionally, you are immune to the Mind Blast attack from mind flayers or other illithids.
