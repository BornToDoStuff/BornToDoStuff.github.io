This monotone pocket watch is mesmerizing to a fault. Itâ€™s somehow cheering though, and as a bonus action you can pull it out to check the time, gaining an extra spring in your step and a +10 bonus to your movement speed for the next minute.

<div class="curse">
Any creature who checks the time on this watch is momentarily disoriented. They are unable to read a map or discern cardinal directions for the next minute, making it very easy for them to become lost.
