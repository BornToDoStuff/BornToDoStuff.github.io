This gauntlet is covered in hickory slabs where there would otherwise be plates of metal. Each of these slabs has runes carved into its roughly-hewn face that have been filled with dirt over time. This item has 3 charges and regains 1 expended charge each morning at dawn.
If you are within armâ€™s reach of a tree as an action you can expend a charge and press your hand against the tree to draw a weapon or pieces ammunition from it. This can be any weapon you are proficient with or 1d4 pieces of ammunition for any weapon you are proficient with. The look and feel of each weapon changes with the type of tree it is drawn from, but these differences do not affect its function in any meaningful way. On a critical failure with any weapon created this way, or after 1 day without being bathed in water, the weapon splinters beyond repair. If you spend an action to return an un-splintered weapon created in this way to a tree within arms reach the gauntlet regains an expended charge.
