This bullseye lantern's glass pane is frosted over but it still emits a strong blue light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. This light can't be turned off nor does it require fuel but instead of the lantern emitting heat it instead has a chilled aura as if a cool autumn breeze is constantly blowing about it.

Any Ooze or Shapeshifter that begins or ends its turn within the bright light of this lantern takes 1 cold damage.
