This large acorn is covered in delicate carvings of leaves and vines and has been carefully preserved in a glass vial. The first time the acorn touches dirt it explodes with life, covering everything around it in verdant flora. Over the next minute the acorn erupts into a massive tree, 120 feet tall, and with a trunk easily 10 feet in diameter. During the following hour a grove of trees springs from the ground in a 100 foot radius around the towering tree and all manner of flora along with them. Small dancing lights illuminate the bows of these trees both night and day, providing dim light to those under the trees. Undead and fiends are unable to enter the grove and can not possess, charm, or frighten creatures within it. Any creature possessed, charmed, or frightened by such a creature is no longer affected upon entering.
