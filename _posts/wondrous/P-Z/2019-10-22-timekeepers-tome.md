This ancient leather tome is thick, and immensely heavy. It's dusty pages contain all of history, mundane or epic as it might be. Each time you open this book the pages within it have different information than before, but not always the information you seek.

### Complete History

While holding or carrying this book if your total roll for an Intelligence (History) check is less than your Intelligence score, you can use your Intelligence score in place of the total.

### Ancient Lore

When you open this book you can name or describe a person, place, or object. When you do so the tome opens to a page containing information and lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known.

The more information you already know about the chosen subject, the more precise and detailed the pages in the tome are. The information you learn is always accurate, but may be not be all the information available, or be obscured by figurative language.

Once used this property of the tome can not be used again until the next dawn.
