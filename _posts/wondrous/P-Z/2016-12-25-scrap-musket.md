This piece is an artful combination of steel and wood that looks like it has had better days. A long dented metal barrel flairs from the gouged wooden stock. Each time you pull the trigger a muffled boom and an orange glow erupts from the barrel. The musket has the following properties: ammunition (range 30/60), loading, two-handed and it weighs 8 pounds. To load the musket you can jam a handful of ammo or rocks down the muzzle. This consumes 50 ball bearings, 10 sling ammo, or (if your DM allows it) a handful of rocks or debris.

On a successful hit this weapon does 1d12 + your Dexterity modifier bludgeoning damage to the target. You do not have disadvantage in close combat while making ranged attacks with this weapon.

<!--excerpt-->
### Flaired Barrel
On a successful hit you deal 1 bludgeoning damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target.

### Expanded Chamber
On a critical hit with this weapon the target creature is pushed back 5 feet and must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Final Warning
As an action if the musket is loaded you can fire it into the air, rapidly pulling the trigger multiple times to overload it. When you do so designate a 30-foot cube originating from you. On the start of your next turn each creature in the designated cube must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw as the ammunition fragments rain down. On a failure the creature takes 4d8 piercing damage, or half on a successful one.
This feature can be used once per day without damaging the musket.
