This unique bracelet is made from snake vertebrae and features silver and topaz charms. When within 15 feet of a snake the vertebrae vibrate subtly, creating a quiet rattle.  
As an action you can choose to transform into a snake. You can choose to appear as any species of snake and for your size to either be Tiny or Huge. Your hit points, physical, and mental ability scores are not replaced; However you are limited in the actions you can perform. You cant speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. Additionally, your gear melds into the snake form and you can not activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from your equipment. As an action, or if you become incapacitated, you revert to your original form.  
If you are a Tiny snake you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and a climbing speed of 20 feet. If you are a Huge snake you gain advantage on Intimidation checks and Strength checks. As either size you gain Blindsight out to 10 feet.
