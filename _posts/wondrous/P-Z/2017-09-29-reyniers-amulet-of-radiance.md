This smooth sphere of silver is embedded with a large number of amber stones and has a pinpoint hole at the very bottom. This amulet holds 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each dawn.

As an action you can hold this amulet above your head and shine a light into the hole, activating the amulet and expending a charge. For the next minute the amber stones emit piercing threads of light and while you hold this amulet above your head any undead that end their turn within 15 feet of you take 1d8 radiant damage.
