This pendant is a deep purple amethyst set into a wide black metal base etched with  ever expanding ripples. It hangs from a small chain with a gap in the back where the clasp would be yet holds together despite the missing clasp. When you pull it over your head the gap expands and then retracts to fit the pendant snugly against your neck. This pendant has 4 charges, and regains 1d4 expended charges each dawn.

As a bonus action you can expend a charge to activate the pendant and create an invisible barrier of force particles around you. The first attack that hits you before the end of your next turn is reduced by 2d10 + your Constitution modifier, expending the barrier. If you reduce the damage of this attack to 0 it is reflected back and the target of the attack becomes the creature or object that attacked you.
While this barrier is active you take no damage from <magic-spell>Magic Missile</magic-spell>.
