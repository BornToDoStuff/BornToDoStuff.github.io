Roots gnarl over your knuckles as you put on these living gauntlets. Dull green leaves are growing out of its gray bark alongside the knots and spines.

While you are wearing these gauntlets your unarmed attacks deal 1d4 Bludgeoning damage. Additionally, on a critical hit with these gauntlets you deal an additional 2d4 Poison damage.
If you know Druidic you can verbally command these gauntlets to change their form as an action. When you do so you can change the damage type you deal with unarmed strikes while wearing these gauntlets to bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing.
