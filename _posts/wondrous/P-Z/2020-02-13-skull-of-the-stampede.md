This helmet is made from the skull of a primeval bison and itâ€™s horns are covered in runes. While wearing this helmet if you move at least 10 feet in a straight line after taking the Dash action, you begin to stampede. Your stampede ends if you stop moving in a straight line or at the end of your turn. You can stampede multiple times per turn. 

While stampeding you have resistance to all damage except Psychic damage. Additionally, while stampeding if you would move through the space of an object or creature that is Large or smaller you can make a melee attack with proficiency against the target. On a hit you deal 3d10 magical bludgeoning damage and the target is pushed 5 feet to the left or right, your choice. On a miss you slam into the target and your stampede ends.
