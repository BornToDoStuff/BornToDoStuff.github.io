These translucent crystal chimes have a joyful tinkle as they sway in the wind.

Any creature that can hear these chimes while taking a long rest reduces their exhaustion level by 2 instead of 1.  
Additionally, any creature within 30 feet that can hear these chimes has advantage on saving throws against being Frightened. After a creature gains advantage in this way they are no longer effected by the chimes until after their next long rest.
