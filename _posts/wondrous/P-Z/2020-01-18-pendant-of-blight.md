This pendant is made of pewter and black iron, and has a blood red ruby in the center. As an action, you can activate the pendant, forming a scarlet circle of magic runes at your feet for a brief moment. Small plants, brush, and grass within a 10-foot radius of you begin to wither as if targeted by the spell <magic-spell>blight</magic-spell>. On your next turn you can choose to gain 3d6 temporary hit points, cast a ritual spell as an action without expending a spell slot, or cast a spell of 5th level or lower as if it is one level higher.

<div class="curse">  
  
**Curse.** If less than half of the 10-foot radius is covered in living nonmagical plants you take 3d6 necrotic damage that can not be resisted or reduced in any way, but still gain the effects of the pendant on your next turn.
