These soft leather shoes don't appear special in any way until you see the soles. The soles of these shoes are littered in runes written in complicated interlocking patterns.

While wearing these slippers you can not be tracked except by magical means. You leave no tracks or sign of your passage, no matter the terrain, and your tread is completely silent, even through things such as dry leaves or snow.Â 

Additionally, as an action, you can activate the slippers to cast <magic-spell>Pass Without Trace</magic-spell> ignoring concentration. Once used, this property of the slippers can't be used again until the next dawn.
