This ebony staff is topped with a lifelike hand carved from shimmering translucent crystal.  
It has 10 charges and regains 1d10 expended charges each day at dawn. While attuned to this item you are able to cast <magic-spell>Mage Hand</magic-spell> if you were not able to before and your mage hand looks identical to the staff's crystalline hand. Additionally, you can use this staff as a spellcasting focus.

#### Shimmering Shield
As a reaction to you or a creature you can see being targeted by a ranged weapon or ranged spell spell attack you can expend a charge to create a 10-foot wide 15-foot tall crystal hand between the targeted creature and the attack. Each time a hand is created it appears in a brilliant flash of dazzling lights and each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be Blinded until the beginning of it's next turn.  
This crystal hand lasts until it is destroyed or until you use this feature again. It has 12 AC and 30 hit points and is vulnerable to Force damage.
