This light leather bag is attached to an inverted wooden funnel with a cork stopper where its drawstring would be. The bag can hold 20 sling bullets which just barely fit through the funnelâ€™s opening.

As an action you can uncork the bag and focus on it, choosing a target you can see that is within 120 feet of you. On your next turn if your target is still visible and in range as an action you can guide a sling bullet out of the funnel, sending it darting around cover to its target and dealing 1d4+1 magical bludgeoning damage.

When you spend an action in this way you can also choose a new target.
You can reload the pouch, either placing 1 sling bullet through the funnel as an action or bonus action, or by spending 1 minute to reload all expended bullets.
