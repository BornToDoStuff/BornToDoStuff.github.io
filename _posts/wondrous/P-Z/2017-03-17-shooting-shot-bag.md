This light leather bag is riveted to a wooden cone with a cork stopper where its drawstring would be. The bag can hold up to 20 sling bullets which just barely fit through the cone's opening.

As an action you can uncork the bag and focus on it, choosing a target you can see that is within 120 feet of you. At the beginning of your next turn if your target is still visible and in range a bullet whistles out of the funnel darting to the target, and dealing 1d4+1 magical bludgeoning damage.

You can reload the pouch, either by placing 1 sling bullet through the funnel as a bonus action, or by spending 1 minute to reload all expended bullets.
