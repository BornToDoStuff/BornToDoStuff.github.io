This amulet is a tiny book carved from black opal and the title is written in an incomprehensible language. Once per day while wearing the amulet you can activate it and choose any language that you have heard spoken before. While the amulet is active it repeats the literal meaning of everything said, within hearing range, in the chosen language in common.
