The Gloves of Silence are a pair of white kid leather gloves, and seem to fit as if they were made for you. 
As an action you can make a performance check as an attack against the armor class of a target within 5 feet, on a hit you deal 1d4 plus your Charisma modifier Psychic damage and create a 5 foot zone of silence centered on yourself that lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You cannot apply expertise on performance checks made in this fashion. If you can make multiple attacks this replaces one of them.
Additionally while you are wearing these gloves they have a 1 inch aura of silence over their surface at all times.
