These leather gloves are singed with a delicate web of right angles.  
This item has 5 charges and regains all expended charges each day at dawn. Additionally, you can use these gloves as an arcane focus.

While casting a spell if you are wearing these gloves you can expend a number of charges equal to the spell slot used to ignore any verbal or somatic components for the spell. When you expend charges in this way the gloves network of burns glows with energy that varies in color depending on the school of magic.
