These leather gloves are wrist length and seem to be burned with a delicate, asymmetrical web of right angles.
The gloves have 5 charges and while casting a spell if you are wearing the gloves and expend a number of charges equal to the spell slot used you may ignore any verbal or somatic components for the spell. When you expend charges in this way the gloves network of burns glows with energy that varies in color depending on the school of magic.
The gloves regain all expended charges each day at dawn.
