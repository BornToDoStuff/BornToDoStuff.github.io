You see a bonsai tree within a simple glass enclosure. It has a well shaped clay dish and cork around its lip, sealing off the glass tube over the small tree. Despite the tree being completely enclosed you can see an obvious breeze swirling around the glass. When you pull the glass off there is a small burst of air and the breeze dissipates.  
Each day the tree sheds a single leaf. This leaf does not wither no matter how long it dances along in the breeze within the bottle. Any leaf that is plucked from the tree has no special properties.  

If one of these leaves is crushed or ripped <magic-spell>Gust</magic-spell> is cast. As a bonus action you can control this effect by cupping your hands around the leaf.  
If more than three of these leaves are crushed or ripped <magic-spell>Gust of Wind</magic-spell> is cast. As a bonus action you can control this effect by throwing one of the leaves into the wind in the direction you want it to go.  
If there is ever more than 10 leaves in one place, or the bonsai container is opened when there is more than 10 leaves, <magic-spell>Wind Wall</magic-spell> is immediately cast in whatever shape the DM chooses.  

**Timeless.** On a successful DC 14 Nature check you estimate that this bonsai must be hundreds of years old, and is in excellent condition, yet you see no signs of it needing to be watered. You reason that it must somehow subsist on sunlight alone within its glass enclosure.
