This appears to be a normal deck of red backed playing cards, but if you inspect it closely there is a faint aroma of spices and the pattern on the cards is tiny mixing bowls, spoons, and aprons. These cards are never in the order you remember, as if they magically shuffle themselves when you arent looking. 
If a creature has Truesight they can see that each of these cards is in fact a spice or ingredient that has been manipulated to function as a playing card.

As a bonus action you can draw a card from the deck and consume it, return it to the deck, or give it to another creature. If you give it to another creature they may consume the card as a bonus action on their turn if they so choose. 
When you first put it into your mouth all you can taste is the bitterness of inked paper until suddenly flavor explodes over your tongue.

### Flavors

**1:** The flavor, it is indistinguishable. It is as if all the others have mixed together in the worst way. You spend the next turn wretching and can not take a reaction for the next minute. If you can handle this though, you can handle anything. For the next 10 minutes you can not taste anything, you are immune to the Poisoned effect, and are resistant to Poison damage.

**2-3:** Chili, cayenne, or pepper. You have never tasted spice this strong before, you take 1d4 fire damage and your mouth nearly glows it is so hot. For the next 10 minutes you can not burn your tongue while eating or drinking, any creature that you bite takes an additional 1d10 fire damage, and you do not feel full while drinking liquids.

**4-5:** Peppermint or spearmint. The fresh taste seems to spread, tingling over your whole body. For the next hour your movement speed increases by 15, but everything that you touch is cold, and almost feels electric. You are vulnerable to Lightning and Cold damage for the duration.

**6-7:** Garlic. The intensity of garlic emanates not just from your mouth but your entire body. For the next day you have disadvantage to any Charisma checks you make while talking to people, but undead will not willingly move within 10 feet of you. Additionally, as a bonus action you can make a breath attack against a creature within 5 feet and that that creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 Poison damage. This deals 3d12 Poison damage to vampires and vampire spawn.

**8-9:** Oregano and Sage. The earthy flavors bring you a sense of immense earthly wisdom. For the next hour you have advantage on all Intelligence and Wisdom checks and saves, however for some reason your vision goes fuzzy. For the duration creatures and objects farther than 30 feet away are considered heavily obscured for you.

**10:** Allspice. The flavors have melded in a pleasant and well refined joy to the tongue. You feel your mind relax and transcend your mortal restraints. Your exhaustion level is reduced to 0, and for the next minute you are proficient in all skills and saving throws.
