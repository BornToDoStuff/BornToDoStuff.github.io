This amulet is a heart of hammered brass, with flames of gold and copper twisting around it. If you speak Ignan you know that this is an insignia of the Order of the Fiery Heart. While wearing this amulet you have advantage against exhaustion checks due to cold weather and resistance to fire damage. As a reaction to making a saving throw against taking cold damage you can choose to succeed the saving throw before rolling. Once you have used this feature you can not use it again until the next day at dawn.
