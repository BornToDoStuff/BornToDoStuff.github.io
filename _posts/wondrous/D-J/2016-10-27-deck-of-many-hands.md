This box contains 15 black ivory cards. The deck contains 3 cards each of Spiked Gauntlet, Hand of Death, and Stone Fist as well as 6 Strong Hand cards.
You may randomly draw a card as an action or bonus action and throw it into the air, forming a floating disembodied hand depending on the card. Each hand lasts 1 hour, until dismissed as an action, or otherwise specified. When their time runs out or they are dismissed their respective card reappears in the deck. These hands move with you, slowly floating around you waiting for commands, and can move up to 30 feet from you.

### Army of Hands
As an action you can command up to three hands currently floating around you to do anything they are able to as long as it is within range.
If you are not a caster your spellcasting ability for the sake of using this item is your constitution modifier.

**Strong Hand.** This rather large hand can manipulate objects, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. It can’t attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 30 pounds.
If commanded to it can attempt to shove a creature of medium size or smaller using your proficiency and spellcasting ability. On a successful shove it dissipates and it’s card reappears in the deck.

**Spiked Gauntlet.** This armored hand has spikes on its knuckles and can manipulate objects, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. It can’t activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.
If commanded to it can make a melee attack against a creature within range using your proficiency and spellcasting ability. On a hit it deals 1d4 magical piercing damage and dissipates, it’s card returning to the deck.
The damage dealt by this hand increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4). On a hit it crumbles and it’s card reappears in the deck.

**Hand of Death.** This ghostly skeletal hand is unable to manipulate any objects, or carry anything.
If commanded to it can make a melee attack against a creature within range using your proficiency and spellcasting ability. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Additionally the hand shatters and it’s card reappears in the deck.
The damage dealt by this hand increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

**Stone Fist.** This rough stone hand is unable to manipulate any objects, or carry more than 10 pounds.
As a reaction to any ranged or melee attack being made against a creature within range you can command one of these hands to block it. The attack is completely blocked, the fist shatters, and it’s card reappears in the deck.
