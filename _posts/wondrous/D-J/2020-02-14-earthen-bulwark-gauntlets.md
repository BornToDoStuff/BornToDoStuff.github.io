These gauntlets each have a large facet where you would expect a gem to sit, but instead holds a finely cut chunk of granite. These gauntlets hold 4 charges, and regain all expended charges each day at dawn.  
While attuned to these gauntlets you gain tremorsense out to a range of 10 feet. Additionally, as an action, you can create a 10-foot-by-10-foot wall of hardened earth within 120 feet of you so long as it is touching dirt or sand. This wall is 6 inches thick, has an AC of 13, 50 hit points, and lasts 10 minutes or until you create a new wall. However, when you expend a number of charges you can create and maintain that many additional walls for the next 10 minutes. If a wall cuts through a creatureâ€™s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice).
