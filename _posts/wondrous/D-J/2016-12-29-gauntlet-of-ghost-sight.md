This leather glove has armored knuckle joints and looks as if it would come up to your elbow. When you turn it over it clearly has the visage of an eye tooled into its palm.

While wearing the gauntlet, as an action once per short rest you can open your palm in front of you and activate the gauntlet. When you do so the eye appears to snap open and survey the space in front of it. The air in front of the eye quivers in a 1 foot wide and 15 feet long beam. Any hostile creature within 5 feet of this beam takes 1d4+1 Force damage as an ethereal dart manifests from the beam and passes through cover and armor to strike them. If the beam intersects with a creature the first creature it intersects with must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 3d6 Psychic damage.

Additionally, once per long rest you can mentally activate the gauntlet. For the next 10 minutes if you are within 120 feet of the gauntlet you have Truesight to a range of 5 feet originating from the gauntlet and you are able to see everything within that radius as if you were there. During this time if you target a creature with the spell Scrying the target creature makes their saving throw with disadvantage.
