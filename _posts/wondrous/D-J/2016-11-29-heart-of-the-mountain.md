This item is visibly sculpted to look like a humanoid heart. It has a large ruby depressed into its left side. When you attune to this heart a light within the ruby begins softly pulsating in time with your own pulse, and a soft thrumming can be heard coming from within the stone.

While attuned to this item you must fail 5 death saving throws to die instead of 3.

Additionally, once per day as an action you can choose to cast either <magic-spell>Stoneskin</magic-spell> or <magic-spell>Investiture of Stone</magic-spell> on yourself, ignoring concentration. If you are not a spellcaster you use your Constitution modifier as your spellcasting ability for this effect. If you choose <magic-spell>Investiture of Stone</magic-spell> you gain 1 level of exhaustion as the spell ends.

<div class="curse">
**Curse.** While attuned with this item you are vulnerable to thunder damage.

If you un-attune with this item or it is destroyed you immediately drop to 0 hit points and begin making death saving throws. Additionally, you gain 1d4 levels of exhaustion that lasts for 10 days and can only be removed by <magic-spell>Greater Restoration</magic-spell>.
