This helmet is very notably missing any way to see out of it as its visor is completely solid, but it is overlaid with a multitude of artistically crafted eyes.  
While wearing this helmet you have blindsight out to 60 feet and are blind beyond that radius. Blindsight allows you to see through obscured areas, magical and nonmagical darkness, and you can not be Blinded by most effects, but it does not allow you to see through walls or objects. This particular blindsight allows you to see creatures and objects easily, but things such as words on a page, or colors, are impossible. Creature's basic emotions and health are expressed via color.  
Additionally, creatures trying to determine your thoughts or mood via mundane means, such as an Insight check, have disadvantage while you are wearing this helmet.

<div class="curse">
**Curse.** If you doff this helmet after wearing it for an hour or longer, you are Blinded for 1 minute for each hour you were wearing it, up to 1 hour total. This effect can not be removed byÂ <magic-spell>Lesser Restoration</magic-spell>.
