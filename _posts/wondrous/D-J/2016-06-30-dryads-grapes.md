This odd gift made by a forest dryad appears to be a large cluster of oddly colored grapes. Truly though it is alive, and each day at dawn it grows 2d10 new purple spheres the size of a small marble. While they make look very much like a fruit on closer inspection each sphere is a shiney bulb of wood which is quickly made obvious to anyone who attempts to eat them.
All "grapes" that have been plucked off the vine wither and grow mushy by the end of the day, making them useless.

These little wooden spheres are easily plucked off and the bunch can hold up to 50 of them before it stops growing more. As a bonus action a creature can grab a handful of the wooden orbs and scatter them on an adjacent space. Each time you do this it costs 20 grapes.
Any creature moving from or through this space must make a DC 10 Dexterity check or fall prone. A creature does not have to make this check if they move at half speed. 
If you do this twice on the same square any creature moving from or through this square must make the Dexterity check at disadvantage.
