You find a roughly-hewn branch with a cork stopper in one end. Inside is a yellowed parchment with a song written on it in druidic.  
You are able to sing this ballad perfectly so long as you are able to read it, almost as if you have always known it. If you sing the entire song during a long or short rest, and are in an area suitable for growing plants, vines and saplings begin to spring from the ground with the tallest tendrils stretching to meet your hands like flowers stretch towards the sun.  
You may choose one piece of the plants to help you before they stop growing.

**Leaves.** You take three small shoots with a leaf on them. You can sing a portion of the ballad while placing one of these leaves over a wound as an action. When you do so it will heal the creature for 1d4 hit points before becoming non-magical.

**Young tendrils.** You take several young tendrils and they wind themselves together into a whip. On a successful hit with this whip you can choose to sing a portion of the ballad as a bonus action. When you do so the tendrils spring to life wrapping around the creature and any terrain nearby before becoming non-magical. The target creature is Restrained and must make a DC 13 Strength check at the end of each of its turns to free itself.

**Mature vine.** You take a single mature vine, around 15 feet in length when uncurled. As an action if you begin to sing a portion of the ballad it will slowly writhe and begin to grow once again. It can grasp onto any stationary object of your choice within 15 feet or any inanimate object of your choice it is touching. After it latches on it becomes a non-magical vine 50 feet long and is strong enough to hold up to 500 pounds.
