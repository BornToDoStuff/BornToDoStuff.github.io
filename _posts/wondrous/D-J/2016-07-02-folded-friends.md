These 10 inch squares of paper are beautifully flowered on one side and some even gilded. On the other side they are blank except for an intricately inked magic circle. When you find them there are 1d4+1 sheets.
When someone begins to fold them they continue folding themselves until they begin to resemble a creature and become animated, although they don’t increase in size and only stand a few inches tall. These little helpers last for the next month, until they are damaged, or become wet. They follow commands from whoever began folding the paper.

With a little practice anyone can learn how to create one of the common forms or possibly even something new. The first time you make one of the common forms you must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a success you create the form you tried to make and never have to make this check again for that form. On a failure roll 1d4. On a 4 you are able to use the paper again. On a 1-3 the magic circle is too damaged to attempt it again.    
At the DM's discretion you can attempt to create a new form with different effects, which may be more difficult or have new rules.

#### Humanoid
These little guys can only lift up to 5 pounds but are quite dextrous with their hands, and able to follow rather complex orders. They have a walking speed of 15 and a climbing speed of 5.

#### Elephant
Their triangular build makes them much stronger than most other transformations and they are able to carry and lift up to 15 pounds. They aren’t smart but they can still follow simple two or three word commands. They have a walking speed of 10.

#### Bird
Unfortunately unable to sing, this little bird is able to carry messages written on it, or with it, to a specific location. If shown on a map where to take it and told to "fly" it will be able to navigate exactly to where you pointed, and do its best to fly around storms. It can also return to where it was folded by being told to "go home". They have a flying speed of 30 and a walking speed of 5.
