On this scarred white seed the size of a man's fist you see ancient runes. When you attune with this seed you learn the meaning of these runes and how to awaken it. If you plant this seed in the earth and call it's name; Over the next minute the two jagged birch saplings rapidly form and a stag rises from the ground.   
The stag has hide as tough as bark, with a mane of leaves, and the twin saplings as its antlers. This majestic beast has the statistics of a warhorse but an AC of 16, ignores difficult terrain made of earth, and can not be slowed or damaged by non-magical plants. Additionally, if you are attuned to this stag, while riding it you are granted its protection, and your AC can't be less than 16 regardless of what armor you are wearing.  
It is friendly to you and follows your commands as best as it is able. If you give it no commands it defends itself but otherwise takes no other actions. If this steed dies it returns to its seed form and can not be summoned again for 3d10 days.
