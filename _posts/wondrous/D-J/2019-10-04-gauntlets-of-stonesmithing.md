These gauntlets are made from a dark marbled stone, finely chiseled. They somehow flex and articulate with no visible joints, and are far too heavy to be practical when you first put them on. When you attune with them you feel them suddenly lighten, and you are able to move freely once again.
These gauntlets have 4 charges and regain 1d4 expended charges each day at dawn.
While wearing these gauntlets your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 additional bludgeoning damage.

When you touch a stone surface you can expend a charge as an action to form up to a 10-foot cubed area of the stone you are touching into any shape that suits your purpose. For example, a weapon, statue, or small passage through a wall, so long as the wall is less than 10 feet thick. The object you create can have simple hinges but fine mechanical detail is not possible.
Additionally, if you expend a charge and concentrate for 1 minute, as if concentrating on a spell, you can create a stone object that is no more than 5 feet in any dimension out of thin air.
