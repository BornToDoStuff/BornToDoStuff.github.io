This black leather gauntlet has an intricate bronze ridge down it's back with five carefully cut stone "gems" set in it's winding pattern. You can focus on these gems and choose an area of terrain no larger than a 40-foot-cube within 120 feet that you can see. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in this area in any manner you choose so long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) for at least the duration required to do so: to reshape a 10-foot-cube it takes an action, 1 minute for a 25-foot cube, and 10 minutes for a 40-foot-cube.  
You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot cube, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the area's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes the entire duration for these changes to complete. Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.  
This effect doesn’t directly affect plant growth, natural stone, or structures. The moved earth carries any of these things along with it. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse. Similarly, if these transformations would make the terrain itself unstable it will collapse when you stop concentrating on it.
