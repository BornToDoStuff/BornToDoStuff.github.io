These thick leather gloves go all the way up your forearms and cinch tightly above the elbow. The back of the hand is covered in a white filigree that gently spirals all the way up the glove and the palms are chill to the touch.While wearing these gloves you have resistance to Cold damage and even when Restrained, or Grappled by a creature Large or smaller, your movement speed can not drop below 10.  
If you grapple a creature with both hands while you are wearing these gloves that creature takes 2d6 Cold damage each turn until they are no longer grappled. If they break the grapple they must roll a Constitution saving throw equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus. On a failure they are Restrained by ice until the beginning of their next turn.

As an action once per short rest you can activate the gloves and small particles of snow begin to swirl around you until suddenly the gloves turn into large gauntlets of blue ice. For the next minute your gauntlets are frozen solid but do not inhibit movement. While your gauntlets are frozen you can not be shoved or pushed magically and any enemy creature that ends their turn within 5 feet of you takes 2d6 Cold damage. Additionally, when you make an unarmed attack you can choose to deal Cold damage instead of Bludgeoning.
