These white leather gloves always fit perfectly no matter what size your hands are, and can not be dirtied.  
A true gentleman never dirties his hands, and these gloves will not attune to you until you do something that would have otherwise dirtied your hands while wearing them.

While wearing these gloves if you are above half hit points you cannot take a bonus action, but you can choose to instead take a bonus action as an action. However, when you drop below half health you are able to take two bonus actions each turn.
