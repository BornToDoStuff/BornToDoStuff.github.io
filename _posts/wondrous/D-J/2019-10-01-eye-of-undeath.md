<p>
This glass jar holds a preserved eye suspended in a putrid liquid. It has 6 charges and regains 1d3 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. 
As an action you can expend one or more of the item’s charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spellcasting ability for the attack roll or spell save DC:    
<magic-spell>Inflict Wounds</magic-spell> (1 charge), <magic-spell>Blindness/Deafness</magic-spell> (2 charges), <magic-spell>Ray of Enfeeblement</magic-spell> (3 charges), or <magic-spell>Contagion</magic-spell> (5 charges).
</p>

In addition, you can use this eye as an arcane focus. When casting any of the aforementioned spells while using the eye as your focus, you can expend 1 additional charge to amplify the spell's effect in the following ways:

 - **Blindness/Deafness.** If the creature fails its initial saving throw it has disadvantage on saving throws to end the spell’s effect on itself.
 - **Ray of Enfeeblement.** If a creature fails its initial saving throw, it automatically fails all saving throws against the spell to end the effect on itself. Additionally, it has disadvantage on all Strength checks and saving throws for the duration.
 - **Contagion.** If the target creature fails its saving throw, it is afflicted with Flesh Rot in addition to whichever disease you choose.
