This instrument has graceful blue markings stained onto it radiating from a single diamond embedded in its surface.

Once per short rest as an action you can begin a lilting melody that changes with the rhythm of the battle. For the next 10 minutes as long as you maintain concentration you can use the Help action as an action or bonus action to assist any creature within 30 feet of you with an attack or ability check.

Additionally, while you are concentrating on this song as an action you can invigorate a creature with the sound of your music, granting them 1d8 + your Charisma modifier temporary hit points that last until the beginning of your next turn.
