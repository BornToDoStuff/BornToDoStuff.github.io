This stoppered flask sloshes with a cavernous echo as if its much larger than it appears and always weighs 2 pounds. As an action you can remove the stopper and pour out 1 gallon of fresh water. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. The decanter holds 30 gallons of water in total, and can not be refilled by normal means.
