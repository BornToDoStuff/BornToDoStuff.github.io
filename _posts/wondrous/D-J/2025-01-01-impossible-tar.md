This large barrel is full of a sticky substance that is intensely black and viscous. If the barrel breaks or you tip it over it the substance oozes forth. It takes 1 minute to cover a 5 foot square and can cover up to 20 squares.   
Any creature that enters or ends their turn on a square covered in Impossible Tar must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be Restrained. A creature restrained in this way can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check and on a success it frees itself.  If a creature becomes Prone while Restrained by Impossible Tar it can no longer free itself and must be assisted by another creature.  
The tar lasts for one week outside the barrel, until it is frozen, or until exposed to universal solvent. It is too sticky to put back in the barrel.
