This appears to be a wooden gauntlet made from gnarled oak and a tough brown fabric. Each of the solid wooden slabs fastened to the back of the gauntlet has a different rune on it and on its front it has a circular hole cut from the palm. This gauntlet holds 5 charges and regains 1 expended charge each morning at dawn.  

If you are within armâ€™s reach of a tree as an action you can expend a change and press your hand against the tree to draw a weapon or ammunition from it. This can be any weapon you are proficient with or 1d4 pieces of ammunition for any weapon you are proficient with. The look and feel of the weapon differs slightly depending on the type of tree you pull it from but it does not affect its function in any meaningful way.  
On a critical failure with any weapon created this way, or after 1 day without being submerged in water, it splinters into pieces.  
If you spend an action to return a weapon created this way (that has not splintered) to any tree within arms reach, the gauntlet regains an expended charge.
