These oblong rocks have been compared to a dragonâ€™s egg because of their appearance. They are only the size of a fist but underneath the cracked rocky surface a red hot core is visible. They are usually found near hot springs, and are a commonplace heirloom passed down from generation to generation in the mountainous regions to protect against the bitter winters.
It is inconveniently just a bit too warm to hold and you will take 1 fire damage every turn your skin is in contact with a hearthstone, although it will not start fires. A hearthstone is a boon to the injured and cold, as its aura of warmth has a comfort to it, and every hour you are within 5 feet of the Hearthstone you gain 1 hitpoint. In addition, while its in your backpack or other similarly close place you have advantage against exhaustion checks from cold weather.
