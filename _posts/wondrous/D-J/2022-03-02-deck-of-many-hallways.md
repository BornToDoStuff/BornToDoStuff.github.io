This deck of sturdy playing cards have a beautiful abstract design and when inspecting them you can see an endless void through their suits. While counting or shuffling this deck it is easy to lose track of where you are.
As an action you may draw a card and activate it by placing it against a vertical surface at least 5-foot square within reach. When activated a card opens up an interdimensional hallway. You can choose how for this hallway goes; For instance "until the other side of this wall", or "250 feet", however the maximum distance traveled is the value of the drawn card times 50 feet. Numbered cards' values are equal to their number, while face and ace card values are 10 and 15 respectively.
After a card is activated its suits fade. A faded card has a value of 2 when activated again, regardless of its actual number or type. Once all cards in the deck have been activated this item becomes a mundane deck of playing cards.

### Interdimensional Hallways
Interdimensional hallways created by this deck are always one tenth the length on the inside as they are on the outside, so a 100 foot hallway would only take 10 feet to travel through. These hallways are not visible or tangible in any way from outside them except for the one-way doors at each end and last for one hour or until one of the doors is destroyed. If a door is destroyed before it collapses creatures in the hallway must make a DC 12 Dexterity Saving throw. On a failure they take 2d10 bludgeoning damage and are expelled out of the hallway from the closest door; However, on a critical failure the creature is transported to another plane or demiplane of the DM's choice instead. On a success they take half as much damage and can choose which door they are expelled from.
