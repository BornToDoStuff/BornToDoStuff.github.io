These black gauntlets have gold and feathered edging, with engraved motifs down their arms. 
While wearing them when you cast a spell that deals fire damage the flames flicker black instead of orange and ignore resistance to fire damage. If these black flames reduce a creature to 0 hit points, it disintegrates into a pile of ash.

### Rise From Ash
When you are reduced to 0 hit points instead of falling unconscious or dying you instead burst into flame and turn to ash. Until the beginning of your next turn you do not exist on any dimension or plane, and are considered dead; However, at the beginning of your next turn you return with 1 hit point amidst a wreath of black flames in an unoccupied space within sight of your ashes (or if that is not possible, the nearest unoccupied space). All creatures within 30 feet of this space must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw as they are engulfed in the inferno. They take 8d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.  
After using this feature you canâ€™t use it again for the next 2d6 days.
