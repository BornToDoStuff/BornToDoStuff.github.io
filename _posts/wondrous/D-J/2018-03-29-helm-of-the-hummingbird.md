This light iron helm is painted in a quickly fading green and has small ivory wings jutting from each side.  
Once per short rest as an action you can activate the helm and the wings begin beating until they almost blur and a faint hum can be heard.  
When you activate the helmet you can immediately move up to 60 feet in a straight line. As the wind buffets your face you realize you are not teleporting, but actually running to the spot you envision in your mind.  
While moving in this way you do not provoke attacks of opportunity and you are able to move across liquids.  

The wings keep beating for a while after you activate the helmet, slowly winding down over time. For the next 10 minutes as a reaction on any creatureâ€™s turn you can gain 1 level of exhaustion to repeat the 60 foot movement. Exhaustion gained this way lasts until your next short rest.
