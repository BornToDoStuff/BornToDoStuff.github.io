This necklace has beads made of various different woods, and each type of wood is carved into a miniature replica of that tree's leaf, all strung on a woven cord. Once per turn you can use 10 feet of movement to magically step into one living tree within reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be Large or larger.

### Dryad's Pact

Over the course of an 8-hour ritual you can create a bond with a Huge or larger tree and the dryad living within. As long as this tree is alive once per day you can cast one of the following spells without a spell slot and ignoring material components: <magic-spell>Commune</magic-spell>, which puts you in contact with the dryad also bonded with your tree; <magic-spell>Find The Path</magic-spell>, if the destination is your bonded tree; or <magic-spell>Commune with Nature</magic-spell>. If you create a bond with a new tree you may incur the anger of the previously bonded dryad because of your unfaithfulness. If your bonded tree is killed you immediately suffer 5d10 Psychic damage that can not be resisted or decreased in any way.
