This otherwise ordinary pick has three empty facets in its head where gemstones might be set. Each facet is surrounded by a delicate circlet of runes.  
When you make a successful attack with this weapon it gains one charge.  

As an action you can press on a semi-precious stone or gem set within one of this item's facets and expend a number of charges to magically refine it. Expending 5 charges increases its value by 10 gold. Expending 10 charges increases its value by 25 gold. Gems and semi-precious stones refined in this way can not be increased to be worth more than 100 gold.
