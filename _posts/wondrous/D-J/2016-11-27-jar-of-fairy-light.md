This small jar is made with a thick glass and has several colorful lights that flit about within it, shedding dim light out to 10 feet. You can use this jar of strange lights as an arcane focus. Whenever you cast a spell of first level or higher using the jar as a focus the jar casts <magic-spell>Dancing Lights</magic-spell> at a point within range ignoring concentration. You can choose where these lights appear but can not move them or combine them.
