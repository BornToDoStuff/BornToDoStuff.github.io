This stoppered flask has a faint, nearly indistinguishable sound when shaken. The decanter weighs 2 pounds. This item has 6 charges and regains all expended charges each day at dawn.  
You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three Command words, whereupon sand pours out of the flask and a number of charges are expended. The sand stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:

 - "Pile" expends one charge to create a small pile of sand that can cover a 1-foot-square.
 - "Dune" expends three charges to create a pile of sand that is 10 feet across and is about 5 feet tall. This sand is expelled with some force, and moves Large or smaller creatures that would be covered by the sand to the edge of the pile.
 - "Desert" expends 6 charges to create a veritable sea of sand that erupts from the decanter as a 30 foot geyser. This sand covers a a 20-foot circle and is up to 10 feet deep at it's center. Any creature in the radius of the sand is pushed towards the edge of the area until it would no longer be covered by sand, unless it has a burrow speed.
