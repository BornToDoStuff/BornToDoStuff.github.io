These bracers have a layer of angularly carved stone fastened over a pair of leather gloves. While wearing them and touching stone or earth with the gloves you gain several effects. If you are not a spellcaster these effects use your constitution modifier as your spellcasting modifier.

- As a ranged spell attack you can form a small disk of stone or compacted earth and send it flying at a creature you can see within 60 feet. This does bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. If youâ€™re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
- You can cast <magic-spell>Mold Earth</magic-spell> as an action.
- As an action you can cast either <magic-spell>Earth Tremor</magic-spell> or <magic-spell>Earth Bind</magic-spell>. Once you use this feature you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
