This dark gray heathered cloak is unusually stiff, even more so than the starched capes of nobles, and on closer inspection you surmise that it has a tight weave of wires of varying thicknesses throughout it. It weighs about 6 pounds and will not tear.

While wearing this cloak as a bonus action you can pull it over you to shield yourself. Until the beginning of your next turn you have resistance to piercing and slashing damage but are considered Restrained by the stiff material.
