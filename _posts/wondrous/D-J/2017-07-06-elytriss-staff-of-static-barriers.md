This singed oaken staff has a forked tongue of metal on each end and a hand grip made of padded leather. This staff holds 5 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each dawn.

As an action you can activate the staff, and sparks can be seen flickering between the forks. As you activate the staff a panel of electricity crackles into existence at a point within 60 feet of your choosing. The writhing section of living lightning appears in any orientation you choose. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. It is 5-foot by 5-foot and seems to have almost no thickness.
When you activate the staff you can choose to expend a number of charges. The first charge you expend changes the original panel of lightning to a 10-foot square panel, and each additional charge creates an additional 10-foot panel. You can place these panels as you wish but each panel must be contiguous with another panel.

If any creature attempts to move through or make a melee attack through any of these panels, or if any of these panels cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the panel and take 1d6 Lightning and 2d6 Force damage. On a successful saving throw they are not pushed and only take 1d6 Lightning damage.
If you are not a caster you use your Constitution modifier as your casting ability for these saving throws.
