While wearing these blue-lensed goggles you are able to see in any dim light as if it were bright light, and you are able to see through snow and blizzards with ease. You do not have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, and do not suffer from the Blinded condition, if it would be caused by ice, snow, or other cold weather effects.
