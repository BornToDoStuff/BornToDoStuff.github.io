While this jet black stone streaked with blue orbits you dust and leaves faintly pulse as you walk by. When a large or smaller creature hit you with a melee attack they are automatically pushed 5 feet away from you and can not move closer until the beginning of their next turn unless they succeed a DC 12 Strength saving throw.
