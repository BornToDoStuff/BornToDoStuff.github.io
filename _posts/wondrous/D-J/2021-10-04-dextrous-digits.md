This small cloth bag holds what otherwise looks like a human skeletal hand, however it has far too many fingers and two thumbs. After taking the hand out of the bag, as an action you can press it against a puzzle, combination lock, or knot. It can almost immediately untie any knot with at least one loose end, solve any puzzle that can be held in one hand, or rifle through the combinations of a typical combination lock. If the task it is trying to complete is too heavy, or magically protected, it struggles for a moment before giving up. Each time it completes a task it gives you two thumbs up before once again going limp.
