These short purple gloves are tipped in silver and are made from a light flexible material that seems extraordinarily difficult to tear.
While you are wearing these gloves if you make a successful unarmed attack against a creature that is concentrating on a spell that creature is marked for the next minute. As a bonus action you can choose a marked creature and force them to make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 8 plus your proficiency modifier. On a failure they lose concentration, and they are unable to cast any spells until the end of their next turn.

Additionally, once per day you can activate the gloves as an action and in a violent purple flash an Antimagic Field appears around you, as if you cast the spell <magic-spell>antimagic field</magic-spell>, that lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
