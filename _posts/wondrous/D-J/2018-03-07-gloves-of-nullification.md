These short purple gloves are tipped in silver and are made from a light flexible material that seems extraordinarily difficult to tear.   
While you are wearing these gloves if you make a successful unarmed attack against a magic caster they do not have to make a Concentration check until the end of your turn. At the end of your turn they feel a sudden drain of magic power and must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to the total unarmed damage you dealt to the caster during your turn. If they fail this saving throw any spell they were concentrating on immediately ends, and they are unable to cast any spells until the end of their next turn.

Additionally, once per day you can activate the gloves as an action and in a violent purple flash an Antimagic Field appears around you, as if you cast the spell, that lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
