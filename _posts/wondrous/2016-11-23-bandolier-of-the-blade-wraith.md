You find 1d6 (or a number up to 6 determined by your DM) small shortswords with dark hilts on a thick bandolier that can be adjusted to fit around the chest or waist. You must spend a short rest with each sword to attune with it, but if you attune with at least one sword any additional swords do not require an attunement slot.

In addition to being able to use these swords as a typical shortsword, as an attack action you can throw a sword into the air or at a creature you can see within 30 feet. If you throw the sword into the air it orbits you at arm's length for 1 hour or until you dismiss it, waiting for you to command it. 

If you throw the sword at a creature, or as an attack action command a sword to attack a creature that you can see and is within 30 feet, it flies at the target avoiding cover and obstacles. When you do so you make an attack roll with proficiency and your Strength or Intelligence modifier. On a hit it deals 1d6 + your Strength or Intelligence modifier magical slashing damage. At the end of the hour, when you dismiss it, or after it attacks a target, the sword will return to the bandolier if you are wearing it, flying around obstacles to do so. If you are not wearing the bandolier it will instead fly to your hand if you have a free hand, or stab itself into the ground at your feet if you do not.

Note: The player can later find more swords if you want to make it increase in power slowly, or even find more than 6. Nothing says they can’t have say a dozen of these wraith swords.
