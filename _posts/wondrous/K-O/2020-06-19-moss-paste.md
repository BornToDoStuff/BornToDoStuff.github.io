This large metal tin opens to reveal a sticky dull-green paste. When applied to any surface besides metal or glass it easily sticks, and rapidly grows athick layer of moss and other small plants. If you cover yourself with this paste after 1 minute you have a layer of natural camouflage that lasts up to a day before it falls off. There is enough paste in the tin to cover 4 small or medium creatures.

While covered in moss paste if you hold completely still while in an area of heavy foliage you can not be seen unless the searching creature makes a successful DC 18 Wisdom(Perception) check, or is within 15 feet of you and has a Passive Perception of 15 or higher, so long as you are not wearing metal armor.
