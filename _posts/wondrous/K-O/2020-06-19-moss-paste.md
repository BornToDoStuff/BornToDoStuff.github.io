This large metal tin opens to reveal a sticky dull-green paste. When applied to any surface besides metal or glass it easily sticks, and rapidly grows a thick layer of moss and other small plants. If you cover yourself with this paste after 1 minute you have a layer of natural camouflage that lasts up to a day before it falls off. There is enough paste in the tin to cover 4 small or medium creatures.

While covered in moss paste if you hold completely still in an area of heavy foliage you can not be seen unless the searching creature makes a successful DC 18 Wisdom(Perception) check, or is within 15 feet of you and has a Passive Perception of 15 or higher.
