This large metal tin opens to reveal a sticky dull-green paste. When applied to any surface besides metal or glass it easily sticks, and over the next minute a thick layer of moss and other small plants grows. If you cover yourself with this paste after 1 minute you have a layer of natural camouflage that lasts up to 1 day before it falls off. It takes about Â¼ of the tin to cover a fully grown human. 

While covered in moss paste if you hold completely still while in an area of heavy foliage you can not be seen unless the searching creature makes a successful DC 21 Wisdom(Perception) check, or is within 15 feet of you and has a Passive Perception of 15 or higher, and so long as you are not wearing metal armor.
