While wearing this masquerade half-mask your mind and aura is masked as well.  
After each long rest you can choose a race of humanoid from the following: Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Halfling, or Human; or the Undead creature type. Until you choose a new type you appear as the chosen type to spells and magic effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense, or the trigger of a <magic-spell>Symbol</magic-spell> spell.  
Additionally, any creature or effect that tries to read your mind can find no evidence that you are any type other than the one you chose.
