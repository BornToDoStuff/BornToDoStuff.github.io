These bracers have a layer of leather to give them their flexibility but the bands of silver underneath the leather are apparent, not to mention the plates of silver with pearl inlays along the back of the bracers. Extending backwards from the wrist area of each bracer is a single silver spine.

Once per long or short rest as a bonus action you can begin concentrating on the bracers as if you are concentrating on a spell. As you do so large translucent bubbles project from the spines and coalesce into a sphere around you. For the next 10 minutes while you maintain concentration any damage you, or any other creature you consider friendly within 15 feet of you, take is reduced by your Intelligence modifier. This effect does not apply to psychic damage.
