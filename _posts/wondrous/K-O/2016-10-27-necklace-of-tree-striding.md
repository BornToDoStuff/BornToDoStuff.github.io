This necklace has a pendant of jade with the bronze semblance of a tree entwined around it. It has 3 charges and you regain all expended charges each day at dawn.
As a bonus action you can expend a charge to enter a tree within 5 feet of you. When you enter the tree you instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 30 feet and, as part of the bonus action used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree youâ€™re in. You can then appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the same tree or a tree of the same type within 30 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you.
You must end your turn outside a tree.
