This quarterstaff is made from an ancient wood that is graying from age but is still stout and stable. At the bottom it has an iron cap and near the top 8 roughly hewn bells of several sizes, sprouting out wildly at all angles. Wrapped around every bell is a ratty cloth, silencing it.

This quarterstaff weighs 6 pounds, does 1d8 bludgeoning damage, and has the Versatile(1d10) property.  
When you attune to this quarterstaff you realize that the bells are more than a noisy addition that must be silenced, but that each holds a portion of magic power that is unleashed as they are unbound.

### Unbinding
When you unbind the first bell you feel a small surge course through your body. Each bell rings out with a chorus of clanging as it is released from its wrappings, as if the sound itself was trapped within the binding. This quarterstaff has 1 charge for every bell it currently has unbound and it takes 1 action to unbind a bell. It regains 1d8 expended charges each day at dawn.  
If you have any number of bells unbound you have disadvantage to stealth checks while holding the quarterstaff.

### Toll the Bells
As an action you can strike this quarterstaff against the ground or against a nearby object, expending a charge as the bells peal. Any creature within 30 feet of you that can hear the bells has disadvantage on their first weapon attack against you on their next turn. Additionally, until the end of your next turn you have advantage on your first melee attack against any affected creature.  
On a successful melee attack with this quarterstaff against an affected creature you can choose to gain temporary hit points equal to the damage you deal.

<div class="curse">
**Curse.** The first time each bell is unbound you lose 1d6-1 max hit points as you hear its discordant chime. These hit points can not be restored, even by <magic-spell>Greater Restoration</magic-spell>, until you are unattuned. Additionally, you can not unattune to this weapon until all bells have been covered with a strip of cloth and then the spell <magic-spell>Silence</magic-spell> is cast on it.
