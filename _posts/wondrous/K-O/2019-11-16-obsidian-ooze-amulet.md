This jet black amulet is made from hardened sludge that once belonged to a black pudding and trembles faintly as you hold it. While attuned to this amulet you have blindsight out to 60 feet and can sense when an ooze is within 120 feet of you, even through walls. Additionally, any acid or poison damage you take is reduced by 5.
