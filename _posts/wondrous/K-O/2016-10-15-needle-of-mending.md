This needle has a short length of bright red thread attached to it and the smallest of runes around the eye. If you take 1 minute you can repair any single tear or hole in leather or cloth as long as itâ€™s no larger than 3 feet in any dimension, and all the material is still there. If material is missing and you have more available you can use new material to replace it. After an hour the thread melds into the surface and the seam disappears as if it was never there. The thread never seems to run out.
