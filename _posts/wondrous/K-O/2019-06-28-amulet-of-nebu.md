This amulet made for the Golden One is a circle, shined to a mirror finish, with horns of a cow on either side and a large turquoise set in its base.
It has 7 charges and regains all expended charges each day at dawn. While wearing it you are resistant to Radiant damage and have advantage on saving throws against being Blinded.

#### Eye of Ra

As an action you can expend a charge, making both the amulet and your eyes flicker with an orange light. Choose one point within 60 feet and as you stare at it a 30-foot-radius 120-foot-height cylinder of orange sunlight shoots from the heavens centered on that point. Each creature in the cylinder when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d10 Radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This cylinder leaves light scorch marks on the ground when it fades.

#### Mistress of the stars

As an action you can expend one or more charges, pulling a blue mote of light from the heavens for each charge spent as the turquoise twinkles. These motes of light settle from the sky to orbit around your head for the next hour, shedding a dim light in a 30-foot radius. You can use a bonus action to send one of these starlight motes streaking towards one creature or object within 120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged spell attack. On a hit the target takes 3d12 Radiant damage. Hit or miss if the target is a creature it must succeed a Constitution saving throw or be Blinded until the beginning of your next turn as the mote expires in a flash of light.
