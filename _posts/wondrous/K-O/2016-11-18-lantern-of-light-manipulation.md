This hooded lantern has a cloudy bulb beneath it rather than a fuel canister but otherwise appears as any other lantern when it is lit. However, when it is turned off or runs out of energy wisps of deep black begin to emanate from it. After it has been turned off for 1 minute it begins viciously smoking and creates a 10 foot radius of magical darkness as it devours all the light around it. This magical darkness can not be dispelled but a light spell of level 3 or higher causes it to dissipate for the next hour. For every hour this lantern is turned off it can fuel itself for an equal amount of time, up to 12 hours.
Additionally, while holding the lantern you can focus on another object you are touching and cast <magic-spell>Light</magic-spell> as a bonus action.Â The lantern appears to extinguish but is considered to be on while this effect is active and continues to consume energy for the duration of the <magic-spell>Light</magic-spell> spell.
