While wearing these goggles everything you see looks strange and warped. Colors and patterns weave their way through your vision and at times even appear like spectral creatures. Because of this while wearing these goggles you can not read or reliably discern color, and you make all Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks with disadvantage. However, illusions are almost imperceptible to you. You automatically succeed on saving throws against visual illusions such as <magic-spell>Hypnotic Pattern</magic-spell> or <magic-spell>Major Image</magic-spell> as long as you are wearing these goggles.
