This bundle of ancient cloths is meant to be wrapped around the hands, legs, and upper arms to serve as basic protection in a fight. You can put on or take off the wrappings during a long or short rest, and while wearing them in this way each time you successfully hit a creature with an unarmed attack the wrappings unravel slightly and gain one charge. The wrappings can store up to 10 charges as more of the cloth loosens and frays. These charges last until your next short rest as the wrappings slowly repair, weaving themselves back together.

As a bonus action you can expend a number of charges to teleport up to 10 feet per charge expended to an unoccupied space you can see. When you teleport in this way you disappear in a flurry of cloth scraps that dissolve into dust.
