These bracers have alternating bands of silver and pearl underneath the plain leather exterior that lay flat against your skin. The bands of silver have fine barbs that poke through the bracers to make several rows of spikes.

Once per long or short rest as bonus action you can begin concentrating on the bracers as if you are concentrating on a spell. As you do so bubbles of energy grow from the spikes and coalesce into a barrier around you before fading.

For the next 10 minutes while you maintain concentration any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage you take is reduced by your Intelligence modifier.

As an action you can focus this barrier to another creature you can see within 30 feet. If you end your turn out of sight or farther than 30 feet away from the creature the barrier returns to you. While you are focusing the barrier around another creature you do not gain any benefit from it but must maintain concentration.
