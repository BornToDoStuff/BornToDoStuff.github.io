This set of white linen clothes has no ornamentation save a simple hem, but is completely spotless and can not be dirtied.

Once per short rest, as an action, you can make these clothes change appearance to any type, color, or style, as long as it is worth 5 gold or less. If a creature touches these clothes they can make a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and on a success realize these clothes are not as they appear.
