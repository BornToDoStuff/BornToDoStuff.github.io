This deep red coin pouch is stitched in gold thread and sinched with a black braided serpent carrying an onyx in it's mouth.  
When attuned with this item you can reach into it to pull out a number of copper, silver, or gold pieces that fit in your hand. You can pull out coins worth up 20 gold per day. If you attempt to pull out more than this in a day you must make a Constitution check DC 15. On a failure you reach in and pull your hand out empty handed, taking 1 Necrotic damage per coin you tried to grab.

### Time Is Money

If you concentrate on the serpent's onyx with the name of a destination in mind you, and up to eight willing creatures that are touching you, teleport to within eyesight of the destination that the name best describes as if using the spell <magic-spell>Teleportation</magic-spell> with a familiarity of Very Familiar. This requires 1 gold, per 25 miles traveled, per creature teleported. If you do not have sufficient gold in your possession when attempting this you take 1d8 Necrotic damage per creature you attempted to teleport, including yourself, and can not use this ability again until your next long rest.

### A Fool And His Gold

As a bonus action you can make any metal within a 5-foot cube in sight range appear as if it is actually gold. This does not change the properties of the metal in any way, and if a creature uses its action to examine it they can determine it is not gold with a succesful Intelligence (Investigation) check DC 18. This effect lasts as long as you are touching or able to see the metal.

<!--excerpt-->
<div class="curse">
**Curse.** After taking out 500 gold, or sleeping while touching this purse, the next night as you rest a Shadow Demon taking the form of a giant snake materializes 120 feet above you with the goal of swallowing the purse. If it succeeds it vanishes and after completing your next long rest you are cursed. If it fails, you get a vision of the current location of Minauros. This repeats each time the conditions are met until the demon succeeds.

When cursed a red and black snake tattoo manifests around your wrist, trailing down your arm. You are no longer considered attuned to the purse but can still use it's abilities with a snap of your fingers so long as the tattoo remains. This tattoo lets Minauros know your location at all times. Additionally, when you use Time Is Money you now descend from a black maw in the sky, pouring down in a dark ichor that slowly seeps into the ground.
