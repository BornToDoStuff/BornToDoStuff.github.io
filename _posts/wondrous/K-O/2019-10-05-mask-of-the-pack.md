This wooden mask is of a majestic black and white canine. As you put it on you can feel the beastial energy emanating from it.
This magical item has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges after a long rest.  

As a bonus action you can use your beastial energy to intimidate a beast within 30 feet of you. The target beast must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for the next minute. The beast can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  

Additionally, as an action you can expend a number of charges as you release a primal howl. When you do so a number of dire wolves equal to the charges spent are summoned to unoccupied spaces around you. These dire wolves are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for them as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue them to the best of their abilities. If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves, but otherwise take no actions. Each dire wolf disappears in a puff of mist when it drops to 0 hit points or after an hour has passed.
