You find an old withered hand, no more than skin drawn taut across bones, and tarnished rings hanging loosely from the fingers. Once per day, as an action, you can rattle the rings on the hand and as you do so the smell of lilies fills the air around you. Choose any number of creatures within 60 feet and those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be Charmed.

While a creature is charmed by this item they must move at least 10 feet towards you each turn if they are able to. They may repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their following turns. If they take any damage or succeed the saving throw they are no longer charmed and are immune to this effect for the next week.

Additionally, as an action or bonus action you can touch a charmed creature within 5 feet of you with the hand. If they are currently charmed by this item they take 4d10 necrotic damage and are immune to this effect for the next week.
