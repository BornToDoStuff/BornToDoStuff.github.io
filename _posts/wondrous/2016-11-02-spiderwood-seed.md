To attune to this rough, black, grape sized seed you must swallow it. Over the course of 1 week several solid wooden growths protrude from your back along your spine. Several of these grow into a number of limber wooden appendages, equal to your level/5 rounded up, and additional limbs grow as appropriate as your level increases.
As an action you can attack with any number of these appendages on your turn. Each limb can attack using your own proficiency and Strength or Dexterity modifier once per turn, and deals 1d8 plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier piercing damage on a hit. 
These limbs automatically regrow 1 minute after being seriously damaged or removed and are each able to hold objects weighing up to 30 pounds, which count towards your carrying capacity. If you have at least two of these appendages you gain a climbing speed equal to half your walking speed and are able to move your full speed while prone. 

<section id="curse">
**Curse.** Once swallowed the seed begins to grow, causing great pain in your upper back, you suffer 1 level of exhaustion which does not go away for the week that the seed is growing and can not be removed even with Greater Restoration. This seed feeds on your life force in exchange for submitting to your control. For each appendage you have 1 hit dice is automatically consumed each day at dawn. Additionally a hit dice is consumed if a limb has to regrow or repair major damage to itself. If there are not enough hit dice for the seed to consume you take 1d8 necrotic damage per appendage. You are not resistant to this damage, even if you normally would be.
If the curse is removed from this item the appendages slowly shrivel, die, and fall off. The attunement is broken, but the wooden knobs on your back remain.
