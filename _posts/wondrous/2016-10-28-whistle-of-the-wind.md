This wooden whistle hangs from a thick twine and when blown does not produce the expected high shrill.    
As a bonus action you can blow through the whistle, seizing the air and compelling it to create one of the following effects.

- One Medium or smaller creature within 30 feet must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from you.
- You create a small orb of air capable of moving one object that is neither held nor carried within 30 feet and that weighs no more than 15 pounds. The object is pushed up to 20 feet away from you, but is not pushed with enough force to cause damage.
- You blow downwards doubling your high jump and reducing any fall damage taken by half until the start of your next turn.
