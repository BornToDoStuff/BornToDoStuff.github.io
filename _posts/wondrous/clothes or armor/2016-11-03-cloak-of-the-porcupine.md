This long cloak is a humble brown, but is covered in long stiff spikes that lay flat.
While wearing it if another creature attempts to grapple you they take 1d4 piercing damage and take damage each turn they continue to grapple you if they succeed.
Additionally each time you take the disengage action you may sweep the cloak at them, making a melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of you, and dealing 1d8 piercing damage on a hit.
