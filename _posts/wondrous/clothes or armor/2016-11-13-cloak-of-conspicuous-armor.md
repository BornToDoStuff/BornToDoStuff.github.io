As an action while wearing this gray pleated cloak you can wrap it around yourself and choose a type of heavy armor. You immediately appear to be wearing the armor you choose. This armor appears polished as if it is brand new, and with embellishments of your choice. This does not affect your AC and you are not considered to be wearing armor for the sake of any bonuses. This effect lasts until you remove the cloak or dispel it as an action.
If a creature touches the armor, or makes a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check DC 15, they are immediately aware of the illusion but otherwise they are convinced so long as they did not see you begin the illusion.
