This light decorative scarf is a pleasant yellow and just large enough to tie around the neck or use as a bandana. They were made popular after a stellar review by a jungle explorer claiming it protected him from a large ape. It is not only a fashionable accessory though, once per short rest if the scarf is placed flat over a solid surface and the command word “banana bandana” is spoken a banana appears as the scarf is lifted. This banana is always ripe, but will go bad by the end of the day if not eaten.
Some have tried summoning other things, even just other fruits with the scarves, but none have yet succeeded.
