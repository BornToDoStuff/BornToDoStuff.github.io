This rawhide necklace has three hands carved from malachite hung between onyx beads. While attuned to this item you are able to cast <magic-spell>Mage Hand</magic-spell> if you were not able to before. When you cast Mage Hand while wearing this necklace you can choose to create up to three hands, these mage hands remain until dismissed, or you cast <magic-spell>Mage Hand</magic-spell> again. You can command any number of the summoned hands with your action and they can work together to lift up to 30 pounds total.
