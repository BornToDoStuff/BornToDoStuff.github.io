This spherical vial is filled with a viscous amber liquid that settles very slowly.

If it is consumed the creature that consumed it gains the following effects for the next hour:

 - Their jump distance is doubled.
 - All jumps count as running jumps, even when made from a standstill.
 - They take no damage from falling, even from great heights.

If it is shattered all creatures that are large or smaller within a 10 foot radius must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure the creature is rapidly thrown 20 feet into the air, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage when it lands, which knocks it prone. On a success, the creature is thrown several feet into the air but does not take damage, nor is knocked prone.
