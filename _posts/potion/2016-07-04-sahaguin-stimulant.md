The primary ingredient for this deep red potion is supposedly shark blood. Any creature that consumes the viscous fluid from it's rough wooden cask gains 3d8 temporary hitpoints and a single action surge (see Fighter's Action Surge) they can use. These each last for one hour, and expire after that time. Any creature that is not a Sahaguin suffers from the Poisoned status the day after they take the stimulant which lasts until they take another long rest.
