As an action you can pour this potion over a section of your body that is severely damaged or missing, such as a hand, toes, tail, or even a whole leg. Over the course of 5 minutes the missing or damaged section is completely restored.

<div class="curse">  
**Curse.** You gain an unnatural interest in fresh humanoid blood after using this potion. Additionally, any of your limbs that have been restored by trollsblood are each cursed as well.Â  If you do not consume humanoid blood for 30 days, any part of your body restored by the potion shrivels, and become unusable until you consume humanoid blood.
