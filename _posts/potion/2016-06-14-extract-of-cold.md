This angularly carved crystal vial holds a thin light blue liquid. The crystal vial feels chilled to the touch and when let sit for long periods of time it forms crystals throughout the liquid that quickly dissipate when disturbed again.
When it's poured out of its container or shattered it steams and hisses as it freezes any inanimate object or liquid it touches. As it pools on the ground it forms a 10 foot square patch of smooth ice. Any creature that crosses this patch of ice must make a DC 12 dexterity check or end their turn and fall prone. It begins to melt after 1 minute.
If it is consumed, the creature must make a DC 14 constitution check unless they are immune to cold damage. On a failure they take 3d6 cold damage and are Paralyzed for 1 minute, they may repeat this saving throw at the end of each turn. On a success they take half damage and are not paralyzed.
