This potion is carefully concocted out of a mixture of different mushrooms found only in the deepest caves. When you drink this potion for the next 10 minutes your walking speed increases by 15 feet, you have a +5 to Perception checks, you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and have up to three reactions which can be used for opportunity attacks.
