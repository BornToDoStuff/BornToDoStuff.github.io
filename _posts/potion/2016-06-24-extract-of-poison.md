A fizzing clear liquid fills this small flask the size of two thumbs. If it is consumed the creature that consumed it suffers from the condition Poisoned until their next long rest and must make a Constitution saving throw DC 14 every minute for the next hour.
On a failure the creature is paralyzed. On a success if they are paralyzed they are no longer paralyzed. After three successful saves (they do not have to be consecutive) or after 1 hour the effect ends and the creature is no longer paralyzed, however they remain Poisoned.
