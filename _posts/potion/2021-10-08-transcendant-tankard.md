This miniature keg is sealed with blue wax and filled with a pint of bitter ale. After drinking all the contents you gain several effects for the next hour.

*   You can see into the Ethereal Plane out to a range of 120 feet as a blue haze.
*   You can see Invisible creatures and objects outlined in a halo of yellow light.
*   You have Tremorsense out to a range of 120 feet.
*   You are Poisoned even if you would normally be immune to the condition.

Each minute you are Poisoned in this way you must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become Stunned for the next minute as you are overwhelmed by everything you see. If the Poisoned condition is removed, or after one hour, you lose all the above effects and gain a level of exhaustion.
