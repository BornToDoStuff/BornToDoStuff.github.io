When thrown this vial of watery red fluid explodes into a fine mist with a radius of 30 feet centered on the point it was thrown. Any undead in this area is Stunned. At the beginning of an affected creatureâ€™s next turn and every turn afterwards it can make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw to end this effect. Additionally, a lich that is exposed to this effect takes an additional 30 days to rejuvenate the next time it dies.
