This vial of scarlet blood can impart special properties to any non-magical weapon or ammunition exposed to it. When poured over a weapon or up to 20 pieces of ammunition it immediately coagulates into a slimy coating. For the next hour it faintly pulses before sloughing off, leaving the weapon blackened, and with a slight red glint. The lacquer can not be used again but the weapon or ammunition gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and deals an additional 1d8 Necrotic damage on a successful attack.
