This vial is extraordinarily tall, almost as long as a man’s forearm. It’s capped with a flat metal stopper etched in a fractal pattern. It has no visible liquid in it yet it feels as though it sloshes, and it produces a dim light out to 5 feet.
When opened all creatures in a 20 foot line must make a Dexterity saving throw DC 14 as a bolt of light lashes out creating a small clap of thunder that can be heard from 100 feet away. On a failure they take 4d6 Lightning damage, on a success they take half.
If it’s shattered all creatures within a 10 foot radius take 1d6 lightning damage and must make a constitution saving throw DC 14. On a failure they are blinded for 1 minute. They may repeat this saving throw at the end of each turn.
