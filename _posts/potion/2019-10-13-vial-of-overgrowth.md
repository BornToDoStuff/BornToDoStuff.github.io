You can see vines pressing up against the sides of this large vial even through the dirty liquid inside it. If you throw this vial when it shatters it immediately covers a 20-foot radius in a mass of vines and small plant life. All creatures in this radius when the vial shatters must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained. A creature restrained by the vines, or one that can touch a creature restrained by the vines, can use its action to make a DC 14 Strength check. On a success, the target is no longer restrained. Additionally, the area now covered in vines and plants is considered difficult terrain.
