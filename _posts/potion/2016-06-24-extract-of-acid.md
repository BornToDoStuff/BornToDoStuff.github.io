A lime green sludge is contained within this oblong vial stoppered by a glass bauble. It froths and bubbles as if constantly in turmoil even when left alone. When it is poured out slowly onto a flat surface it will chew through up to a foot of solid rock or several inches of metal. 
When shattered all creatures within a 5 foot radius take 2d6 acid damage and must roll a Dexterity saving throw DC 14. On a failure they take an additional 2d6 acid damage on their next turn.
