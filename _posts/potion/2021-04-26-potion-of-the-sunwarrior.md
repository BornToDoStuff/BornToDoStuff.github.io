After consuming this potion for the next hour you no longer suffer from Sunlight Sensitivity or Sunlight Hypersensitivity if you did before. Additionally, for the next hour while you are in direct sunlight you regain 1d4 + 1 hit points if you have at least 1 hit point, and you have resistance to Radiant damage.
