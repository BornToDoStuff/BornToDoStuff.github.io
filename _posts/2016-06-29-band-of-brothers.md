The closest of comrades, and often siblings get these wide banded wrist or ankle tattoos. Creatures who share this tattoo know the general direction of their bonded partner at all times.
Whenever the bonded “brother” is suffering or in danger the other can feel twinges of pain from the tattoo. Additionally they gain advantage to all checks to assist their brother when they are in peril.
When a soul brother perishes the other feels intense agony throughout their body originating in pulses from the tattoo and in turn loses 10 years of their own life.
