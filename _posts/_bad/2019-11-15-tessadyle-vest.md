This deep green vest is woven from the rough fibers of the tessadyle fungus and fastens with several buttons made from semiprecious stones. While wearing it your AC can not be lower than 12 + your Dexterity modifier. If this vest has not been exposed to the sun, or the sunbeam or sunburst spells, in the last 24 hours this increases to 14 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, the fibers of the vest themselves seem to want to assist you. While wearing this vest your carrying capacity increases by 100 pounds and if you press an object against the vest the object is held in place for you. You can stick up to 20 pounds to the vest this way.
