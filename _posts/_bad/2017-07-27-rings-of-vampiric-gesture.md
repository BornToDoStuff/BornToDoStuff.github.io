These rings are both identically polished bands of ebony, inset with a red agate. For a brief moment when each is attuned to a separate creature both attuned creatures taste copper and feel as if their ring hand was submerged in a warm liquid.

As a bonus action either creature can activate their ring by pointing towards the other with their ring finger. If on their turn the other creature is within 30 feet and does the same a bond is formed between them. To maintain this bond both creatures must spend their bonus action each turn and end the round within 30 feet of each other or it is broken and must be formed again.

While this bond is active a twisted ethereal cord stretches between the two creatures. This bond cannot be seen by anyone except the attuned creatures, except on the Ethereal Plane, and can not be interacted with. The first time on a turn an enemy creature moves through this cord they must make a constitution saving throw equal to 10 + both attuned creatures constitution modifiers. On a failure they take 2d12 Necrotic damage and each attuned creature regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

<div class="curse">
**Curse.** Every time the bond is broken each attuned creature is Poisoned until the end of their next turn and takes 1d6 Necrotic damage.
