This scroll can be challenging to create as itâ€™s much smaller than most, and is meant to be concealed within a hand. Its for those suitors with a magic flair and a bit of extra pocket change that are unable to master the magic arts themselves.
When held in a fist and squeezed at arms length from the body it erupts into an eloquent bouquet complete with sparkling effects. The exact flowers that are created are usually chosen by the scroll maker. It also has a, possibly too small, arrow pointing in the direction the blossoms will emerge. If it's not spotted roll a d4, even is flowers up, odds is flowers down.
