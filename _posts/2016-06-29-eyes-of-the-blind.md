This tattoo is a circular design, usually in purple or red, on the neck or back of the head. It’s typically shared between blind and visioned siblings, and once per short rest they allow the other to see using their partner’s vision.
when the tattoo is created the left eye of the sighted partner (if they both have fully functional eyes it applies to both of them) glazes over and they are unable to see from it. Whenever the other partner is seeing using the bond the glazed eye of the sighted partner comes back to life for the duration. While this is happening the eye that was taken over is still under control of the sighted partner but it is the color of the blind partner's eyes (or the color they used to be).
