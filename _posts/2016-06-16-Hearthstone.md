These oblong rocks have been compared to a dragonâ€™s egg because of their appearance. They are only the size of a fist but underneath the cracked rocky surface a red hot core is visible. They are usually found near hot springs, and are a commonplace heirloom passed down from generation to generation in the mountainous regions to protect against the bitter winters.
It is a very convenient hand warmer but it is inconveniently slightly too warm and you will take 1 fire damage every turn you are in direct contact with a hearthstone, although it will not start fires.
It is a boon to the injured and cold, as its aura of warmth has a comfort to it, and every hour you are within 5 feet of the Hearthstone you gain 1 hitpoint. In addition, while it is on your person you have advantage against exhaustion checks due to cold weather.
