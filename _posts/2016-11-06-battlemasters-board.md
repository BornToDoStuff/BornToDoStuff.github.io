This game set is extremely unique, as you travel the wooden board morphs it’s ivory inlays to portray major features in the landscape. It has a small drawer underneath it to hold up to 20 figurines, made from precious stones and bone, and weighs 10 pounds. When you find it it has 4 pieces carved from gemstones, 3 pieces made from goblin bone, 2 from human bone, and 1 from ogre bone. These pieces allow you control both friend and foe as you move them across the board in the deadly game of war.
The Bones of my Enemies
You can create a figurine for any type of enemy that is size Large or smaller as long as you have bones from that creature to carve the piece from. To create a piece for the board you must spend a short rest attempting to do so and make a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) crafting check to properly form it. If you fail this check the material used is damaged and can not be used again.
Pieces can be made out of gemstone and precious materials worth at least 50gp in the same manner can be bound to any creature that is willing, no matter the type of creature.
The drawer in the board can only hold up to 20 pieces, but you can create as many as you wish. During a short or long rest you can organize and choose which pieces are stored in the drawer to enable you to quickly identify pieces while setting up.
Set the Playing Field
You can take a turn to set up the board and bind pieces to creatures. If you require pieces that are not in the board’s drawer you may find, take out, and bind 5 additional pieces as an action each following turn. Binding any number of additional creatures from the drawer after the board is set up is a bonus action. To bind a piece to a creature it must be within 300 feet and you must be able to see it. Additionally the piece must be carved from the bones of the same type of creature you are binding it to, unless it is a willing creature. If it is undead the bones must be from the type of creature it was before it died. Once a piece has been bound in this way you cannot bind it to another creature for the next hour.
If the board is moved after it is set up you must spend a turn setting it up again.
Total Control
While the board is set up you can move up to three pieces as an action, choosing one of the following effects for each piece. Each time you move a piece that is bound to an unwilling creature it may make a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting DC. On a success they are not affected. If you are not a spellcaster you use your Intelligence modifier as your spellcasting modifier.
Move. The creature must move up to 15 feet in any direction you choose, this movement does not count towards their movement next turn and is made as if disengaging. A creature will not move if it would certainly lead to it’s death.
Help. You help the creature with your overview of the battlefield as if using the Help action. This can include aiding them in attacking another creature.
Attack. Using the creature’s reaction they must make a melee attack against another creature within reach that you consider an enemy.
Reveal. If you are proficient with Dragonchess you can reveal the position of another creature you have bound. Until the end of your next turn this creature is aware of the revealed creature’s location even if they cannot see them or are blinded, and can ignore up to 3/4 cover against the revealed creature.
