This glass globe has no visible opening on its dark clouded surface, and it is warm to the touch. Its contents appear to be a faintly glowing roiling cloud of flame.
When the globe is thrown or smashed it expands violently into a cloud, reaching around corners, from the point where it landed, and all creatures within 15 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity throw. On a failure they take 3d6 Fire damage. On a success they take half as much.
