This angular shield is pure white with blue fractals emblazoned along its edges. It is said to be forged from the scales of a white dragon to defend an ancient dwarven city. Once per long rest, as an action, you can hold it aloft and speak its command word, forming a solid wall of crystalline ice as if the user cast <magic-spell>Wall of Ice</magic-spell>. Using the shield in this way does not require concentration.
