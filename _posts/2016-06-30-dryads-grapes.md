This odd gift from a forest dryad appears to be a large cluster of off-color grapes. Truly though it is alive, and every day it grows 10 new purple spheres the size of a small marble. While they make look very much like a fruit on closer inspection each sphere is a shiney bulb of wood which is quickly made obvious to anyone who attempts to eat them.

They are easily plucked off and it can hold up to 50 of these bulbs before it stops growing more. As a bonus action a creature can grab a handful of the wooden orbs and scatter them on the ground in a 5 foot square. Any creature moving to or through this square must make a DC 10 dexterity check or fall prone. A creature does not have to make this check if they move at half speed. Each time you do this it costs 20 grapes.
If you do this twice on the same square any creature moving to or through this square must make the dexterity check at disadvantage. They may roll without disadvantage if they move at half speed.
All grapes that have been plucked off the vine wither and grow mushy by the end of the day, making them useless.
