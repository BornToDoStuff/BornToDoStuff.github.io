This pale armor is frigid to the touch, and even in the warmest weather has a thin layer of frost over it. The wearer must endure wearing the cold plate for an entire hour to attune to it. While wearing this armor you gain +1 to AC, you are resistant to cold damage, and are unaffected by temperatures as low as -50. A chilly draft follows you wherever you go. While you are conscious any creature hostile towards you that ends their turn within a 5-foot radius of you takes 1d10 cold damage.
