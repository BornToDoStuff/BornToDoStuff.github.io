This tattoo is an interwoven web of right angles, usually stretching from the torso to fingertips. You gain two abilities and you may use one per short rest.
- You cast a spell up to 5th level ignoring verbal and somatic components.
- You cast any 1st level spell or cantrip that would normally be an action or bonus action as a reaction to being attacked, or as an opportunity attack.
