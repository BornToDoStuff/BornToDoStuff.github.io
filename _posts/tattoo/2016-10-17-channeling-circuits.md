This tattoo is an interwoven web of right angles, usually stretching from the torso to fingertips. You gain two abilities and you may use one per short rest.
- You may cast a spell up to 5th level, expending a spell slot as normal, but ignoring verbal and somatic components.
- You may cast any spell up to 1st level that would normally be an action or bonus action as a reaction triggered by being attacked, or as an opportunity attack. If a spell slot would be expended it is expended as normal.
