This tattoo is a circular design, usually in purple or red, on the neck or back of the head. Itâ€™s typically shared between blind and visioned siblings. When the tattoo is finished the left eye of each creature hazes over and they are unable to see from it.

Once per short rest either of the tattooed creatures can choose to see through their partner's eyes as an action. For the next hour or until this effect is ended as an action the creature that activated this effect can see through the eyes of their partner instead of their own. During this time each of the creature's left eyes are no longer hazed over and become the color of their partner's eyes.
