The closest of comrades, and often siblings get these wide banded wrist or ankle tattoos. Creatures who share this tattoo know the general direction of their tattooed partner at all times.
Whenever the bonded "brother" is suffering or in danger the other can feel twinges of pain from the tattoo. Additionally, they gain advantage to all checks to find or assist their brother when they are in peril.
When a tattooed partner perishes the other feels intense agony throughout their body originating in pulses from the tattoo and loses 10 years of their own life.
