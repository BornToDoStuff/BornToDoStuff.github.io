These tattoos are popular amongst military units. This tribal forearm tattoo allows stupendous synchronization in battle, giving the pair of creatures +1 AC when standing within 10 feet of each other. Their movements almost seem as if they know exactly what the other is going to do next.
However without their bonded partner they appear to be missing part of their senses and while farther than 30 feet from the bonded creature they both have disadvantage to Perception checks.
