popular amongst military units, these tribal forearm tattoos allow stupendous synchronization in battle, giving the pair +1 AC when standing within 10 feet of each other. Their movements almost seem as if they know exactly what the other is going to do next.
However without their bonded partner they appear to be missing part of their senses and while farther than 30 feet from the bonded creature they each have disadvantage to perception checks.
