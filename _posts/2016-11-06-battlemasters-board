This game set is extremely unique, as you travel the wooden board morphs it’s ivory inlays to portray major features in the landscape. It has a small drawer underneath it to hold up to 20 figurines, made from precious stones and bone, and weighs 10 pounds. When you find it it has 4 pieces carved from gemstones, 3 pieces made from goblin bone, 2 from human bone, and 1 from ogre bone. These pieces allow you control both friend and foe as you move them across the board in the deadly game of war.
The Bones of my Enemies
You can create a figurine for any type of enemy that is size Large or smaller as long as you have bones from that creature to carve the piece from. To create a piece for the board you must spend a short rest attempting to do so and make a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) crafting check to properly form it. If you fail this check the material used is damaged and can not be used again.
Pieces can be made out of gemstone and precious materials worth at least 50gp in the same manner can be bound to any creature that is willing, no matter the type of creature.
The drawer in the board can only hold up to 20 pieces, but you can create as many as you wish. During a short or long rest you can organize and choose which pieces are stored in the drawer to enable you to quickly identify pieces while setting up.
Set the Playing Field
You can take a turn to set up the board and bind pieces to creatures. If you require pieces that are not in the board’s drawer you may find, take out, and bind 5 additional pieces as an action each following turn. Binding any number of additional creatures from the drawer after the board is set up is a bonus action. To bind a piece to a creature it must be within 300 feet and you must be able to see it. Additionally the piece must be carved from the bones of the same type of creature you are binding it to, unless it is a willing creature. If it is undead the bones must be from the type of creature it was before it died. Once a piece has been bound in this way you cannot bind it to another creature for the next hour.
If the board is moved after it is set up you must spend a turn setting it up again.
Total Control
While the board is set up you can move up to three pieces as an action, choosing one of the following effects for each piece. Each time you move a piece that is bound to an unwilling creature it may make a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting DC. On a success they are not affected. If you are not a spellcaster you use your Intelligence modifier as your spellcasting modifier.
Move. The creature must move up to 15 feet in any direction you choose, this movement does not count towards their movement next turn and is made as if disengaging. A creature will not move if it would certainly lead to it’s death.
Help. You help the creature with your overview of the battlefield as if using the Help action. This can include aiding them in attacking another creature.
Attack. Using the creature’s reaction they must make a melee attack against another creature within reach that you consider an enemy.
Reveal. If you are proficient with Dragonchess you can reveal the position of another creature you have bound. Until the end of your next turn this creature is aware of the revealed creature’s location even if they cannot see them or are blinded, and can ignore up to 3/4 cover against the revealed creature.^
Bones of a Wandering Soul
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This simple leather pouch has several charred humanoid bones in it and a small dusting of ashes. There is no smell of smoke though, so you know these must be quite old.
When attuned to this bag of bones no matter how far you are from them if you are incapacitated a ghostly figure rises from your body. This is not your soul, and you do not know whose it is. 
While you are incapacitated once per turn you can mentally command the wandering soul to deal 1d8 necrotic damage to the closest creature you do not recognize as an ally within 30 feet. You do not know what or who that creature is, only if it is a creature you already know and if you consider them an ally or not.
If a creature makes a melee attack against you while you are incapacitated they must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened of you for the next minute or until they are farther than 30 feet from you as their mind is bombarded by the wandering soul.
Additionally, while incapacitated you can telepathically reach out to a humanoid corpse that still has its mind and is within 30 feet and determine the answer to a single yes or no question if the creature knew the answer to your question in life. You can do this once per turn and can ask up to three questions of a single corpse before the information in its mind dulls.
Curse. While the wandering soul remains in the bones you can not un-attune from this item unless you are within the area of a Hallow spell. If Remove Curse is cast on this item or the attuned creature the caster must make a DC 16 Intelligence(Arcana) check as the wanderer resists. On a failure the spell does nothing.
If all of the bones are removed from the bag the bones begin to clatter and an Avatar of Death (DMG 164) is summoned within 10 feet of the creature holding the most bones. It screeches at the creature for disturbing its slumber and begins attacking it. It is resistant to any damage from all other creatures, even if the creature holding the most bones changes.
If the Avatar of Death is defeated a putrid black smog wafts out from the bones and they become mundane. If the avatar defeats the creature they were attacking it places the bones back within the pouch and vanishes.
