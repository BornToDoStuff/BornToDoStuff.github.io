This round metal shield is rimmed with clear, un-shattering glass.

While attuned to this shield you have proficiency with Intelligence saving throws if you did not before.
This shield has 3 charges that recharge on a long or short rest. While you are wielding this shield at the end of another creature's turn you can activate one feature, expending a number of charges depending on the feature used.

**Force of Mind.** Expend 1 charge to target a creature within 30 feet and make an Intelligence check contested by the target's Wisdom or Intelligence check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.

**Mental Grasp.** Expend 2 charges to cast <magic-spell>Hold Person</magic-spell>, ignoring casting time. You use your Intelligence as your casting ability when you cast <magic-spell>Hold Person</magic-spell> in this manner.
