This polished armor is heavily adorned with bronze and gold and has a band of red hanging from it's left pauldron. It is said to have belonged to a legendary warrior who led his men to battle with reckless abandon.

While wearing this armor you are immune to being frightened and while charmed if you would injure a creature you consider to be an ally the effect on you immediately ends.  
Additionally, as an action, you can rally your allies to you. For the next minute you emanate an aura of confidence and can not be stunned or knocked prone. For this duration friendly creatures within 30 feet of you are immune to being frightened or charmed, and hostile creatures within 30 feet have disadvantage to Wisdom saving throws.  
Once you use this ability you can not use it again until your next long rest.
