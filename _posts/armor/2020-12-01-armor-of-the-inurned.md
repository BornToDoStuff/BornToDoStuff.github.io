This glistening blue-gray scale mail is made from overlapping plates of a glossy material you can't identify, but it is certainly not metallic. While wearing this armor you have a burrow speed of 20 feet through sand or loose earth, and can still breathe even while completely encased in dirt, sand, or other similar materials.
