This wooden shield is unpainted, instead covered in living vines, and has yet-living branches growing off it's edges. While attuned with this shield you gain proficiency in Intelligence (Nature) checks if you were not proficient before and your proficiency bonus is doubled if you were already proficient. Additionally, you are able to understand plant creatures, and if you speak Druidic they can also understand you.

### Canopy of Protection

While within 30 feet of a Huge or larger plant that is not hostile, you and any other creatures of your choice, have half cover while within range of the plant as the roots and branches reach out to your aid.

### Shephard of the Forest

You can call to the plants around you as if you know each of them by name. If you spend 1 minute touching this shield against a Huge or smaller plant with an intelligence of 3 or less, it awakens. The target plant gains an intelligence of 10, and the ability to speak one language you know. It also gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your DM chooses Statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the Statistics for the Awakened Shrub or the Awakened Tree. The awakened plant is initially friendly towards you but is not charmed or compelled to do as you ask. Once you have used this ability you can not use it again for the next 2d6 days.
