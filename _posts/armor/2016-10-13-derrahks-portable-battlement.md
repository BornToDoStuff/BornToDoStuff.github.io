This shield is made from a thin sheet of solid stone, and is etched with radiating lines.
While you are touching solid ground you may activate or deactivate the shield as an action by speaking the command word. When activated the shield expands, spiking along the radiating lines to a width of 15 feet, a height of 10 feet, and rooting itself and you into the ground. This provides full cover to all creatures behind the shield (including yourself) and while the shield is active you are not able to be shoved, or moved magically, but you are Restrained until you deactivate the shield.
