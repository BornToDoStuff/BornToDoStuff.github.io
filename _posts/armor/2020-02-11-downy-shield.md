This small polished wooden shield has several tufts of flight feathers tucked behind it and white plumage around itâ€™s edge. This item has 3 charges and regains all expended charges each day at dawn.  

As an action while wearing this shield you can activate it by tugging on the flight feathers. When you do so two small wings unfurl from behind the shield, granting you a flying speed of 45 feet for the next minute. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 60 feet per round until you land. If you doff the shield, you lose any flying speed and do not descend slowly.
