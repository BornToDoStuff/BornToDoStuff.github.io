From the jutting angles and rough texture of this snow white plate armor you can tell its obviously crafted from some form of chitin. The underside of each piece of plate is a spectacular orange and flares of color are visible through the chinks of the armor.  

This plate armor is relatively light and its joints are notably flexible. It weighs 40 pounds and is considered medium armor for all proficiencies and class features. While attuned to and wearing this armor you are immune to the effects of extreme cold climates.  
As an action you can expend a charge and when you do so the armor shudders slightly and all joints visibly tighten as you feel a sudden surge of heat. For the next minute any Fire damage you take is reduced by 10. This armor has 3 charges and regains 1 expended charge each day at dawn.  

If you are ever swallowed while wearing this armor the creature that swallowed you must immediately make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure it regurgitates all swallowed creatures. On a success it instead makes all Constitution saving throws to keep you contained in its stomach with disadvantage.
