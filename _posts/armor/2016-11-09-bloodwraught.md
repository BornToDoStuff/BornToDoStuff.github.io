This rectangular shield of dark iron has deep grooves in it stained a dull red.
As a reaction to being hit by an attack you can activate the shield. When you activate the shield you feel a sharp pang in your hand and forearm and the grooves in the shield glow a sickly red as a dark barrier of magical force surrounds you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and are lightly obscured.

**Curse.** Every time you activate Bloodwraught it gains a charge, and you take 1d8 Necrotic damage for each charge Bloodwraught has. These charges reset each day at dawn.
