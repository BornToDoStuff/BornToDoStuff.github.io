This rectangular shield of dark iron has deep grooves in it stained a dull red.    
As a reaction to being hit by an attack you can activate the shield. When you activate the shield you feel a sharp pang in your hand and forearm. You take 1d8 Necrotic damage, and the grooves in the shield glow a sickly red as a dark barrier of magical force surrounds you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and are considered in dim light.
The grooves continue to glow for 1 minute after you activate the shield in this way.

<section id="curse">
**Curse.** If the grooves are still glowing and you activate Bloodwraught again you take an additional 1d8 damage for a total of 2d8 Necrotic damage each time it is activated.
