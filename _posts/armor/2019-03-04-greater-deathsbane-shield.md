This ebony shield appears completely smooth but if you run your hand over its face you can feel a large motif of a skull. It has studs of gold around its edge and on the back is an intricate circle of runes etched in a deep purple.  
When you make a saving throw against an effect or spell that deals Necrotic damage while wearing this shield you may make the save with advantage. If you succeed on this saving throw you take no damage from the effect. Additionally, if you die while attuned with this shield you can not be raised as an undead.
