When you find this chainmail it appears to have a thin film over it and noticeably is trimmed with white fox fur. When you touch the armor it is immediately obvious that the film is frost as the metal is as cold as ice.  
This item has 5 charges and regains all expended charges at dawn.

While you are attuned to this armor you have resistance to Cold damage and are impervious to extreme weather, both cold and hot.  
Additionally, you know the <magic-spell>Frostbite</magic-spell>  cantrip if you did not already.  

<!--excerpt-->
### Numbing Aura
All terrain around you in a 10 foot radius ices over with a magical frost and is considered difficult terrain for creatures other than you. The radius of frost moves with you but does not damage any plants or objects that it freezes. Additionally, any enemy creature that ends their turn on this ice finds their reflexes growing sluggish and they can not take reactions until their next turn.

### Arctic Defense
At the beginning of your turn you may choose to expend a charge to gain 1d4+1 temporary hit points at the beginning of each turn for the next 10 minutes as the armor slowly builds up it’s layer of frost.

### Cold Snap
As an action you may expend 2 charges as you snap your fingers to freeze the enemies around you. All enemy creatures within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure they take 3d8 Cold damage and are Restrained for the next minute as ice races from your feet to clutch at their legs. On a success they take half as much damage and are not Restrained.
A creature who is Restrained by this effect can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If you are not a spellcaster you use your Constitution modifier as your spellcasting ability for this effect.
