This ebony shield is completely smooth and has no adornment on its face; however on its back is an intricate circle of runes etched in a deep purple. When you make a saving throw against an effect or spell that deals Necrotic damage while wearing this shield you may make the save with advantage. Additionally, if you die while attuned with this shield you can not be raised as an undead.
