If this large seed wasn't covered in intricate carvings of leaves you might think that it was just another fruit pit someone threw out.  
As you attune with this item it slowly begins to sprout, sending tendrils around your hands and arms.
As a bonus action while you are touching the seed you can command it to activate. When you do so the seed springs to life, covering you in armoring vines over the next turn. You can don the armor in this way once per short rest.
While wearing this armor you have an AC equal to 13 + your Dexterity modifier and if you know Druidic you can speak to the vines, gaining a climbing and crawling speed equal to your walking speed as the vines assist you.Â You can choose to doff the armor as a bonus action, causing the vines to shrivel and fall off by the end of your next turn, the seed returning to its dormant state.
