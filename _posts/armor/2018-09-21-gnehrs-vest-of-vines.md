If this large seed wasn't covered in intricate carvings of leaves you might think that it was just another fruit pit someone threw out.  
As you attune with this item it slowly begins to sprout as its held in your hands, sending out a small shoot and several leaves. When the attunement is completed the young sprout wraps itself around the seed, mimicking the etchings on it's side.  

As a bonus action if the seed is touching you you can command it to activate. When you do so the seed will spring to life, covering you in armoring vines over the next turn. You can don the armor in this way once per short rest.  
While wearing this armor you have an AC equal to 13 + your Dexterity modifier and if you know Druidic you can speak to the vines, gaining a climbing and crawling speed equal to your walking speed as the vines assist you. You can choose to doff the armor as a bonus action and it will shrivel up and fall off by the end of your next turn, the seed returning to its dormant state.
