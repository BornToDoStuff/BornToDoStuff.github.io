This overly large shield weighs 15 pounds and is covered in dozens of overlapping sheets of metal across its face.
While you have this shield equipped you can activate the shield as a bonus action by uttering the command word. Until the beginning of your next turn you are Restrained as metal plates begin flying off the shield and forcefully forming around your body. Starting at the beginning of your next turn while the shield is activated your AC is 17 + your Dexterity modifier (max 3), including the shield. This counts as wearing medium armor. If you are already wearing armor when you activate the shield the plates begin flying off but are unable to form around your body and return to the shield.
The shield deactivates in the same way it activates, and all the plates return to the face of the shield.
