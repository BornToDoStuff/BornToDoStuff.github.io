While wearing this armor you have control of the four extra arms grafted onto the metal spikes on the chestplate's back. You are not sure what creature these humanoid arms are from, but they are not all the same color or type. These arms can hold anything you can, and do basic tasks such as open a potion bottle, or swing a one handed weapon.

### Extra Muscle
Your four additional arms help you out with strength related tasks, and you gain a +4 bonus when making a Strength check or saving throw, including grapple checks. Additionally, your carrying capacity is increased by 30 pounds for each of these extra arms that are empty and able to assist you.

### One Man Army
When you take the Attack action you can choose to make up to four additional attacks, one for each of the extra arms that are holding a weapon, using the weapon the arm is holding. Once used, this feature can not be used again until after your next short rest.
