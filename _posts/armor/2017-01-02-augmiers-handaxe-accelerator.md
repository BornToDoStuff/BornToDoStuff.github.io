This reinforced metal shield has a crystal orb embedded in its center. On the left side there is a slot, through which you can see it is obviously hollow, and just underneath it is a phrase inscribed in gnomish.

If you insert a weapon with the properties light and thrown into the slot the crystal begins to glow and a distinct whirring can be heard from the shield. As an action you can point the shield at a target and speak the command word expelling the weapon violently. Make a ranged attack (range 80/320) against the target, with proficiency if you have proficiency with shields. On a hit you deal 2d6 damage of the weapon's damage type.

After one minute, or if you insert another weapon into the slot during this time, the weapon(s) shatter and the whirring stops.
