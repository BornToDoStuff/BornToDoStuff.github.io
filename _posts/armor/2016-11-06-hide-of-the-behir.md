This padded armor is covered in mottled blue cracked carapace. While wearing this armor you have resistance to lightning damage. 
As an action you can plant your feet and begin channeling electrical energy as if concentrating on a spell. For the next minute electricity crackles from your head to your feet. You can end this effect early as a bonus action, however, if you lose concentration before you stop channeling you take 4d8 lightning damage.
Once you have used this feature you can not do so again until you complete a long rest.

While channeling, as an action, you can fire a 1 foot wide 20 foot long line of searing lightning from your mouth. When you fire a beam of lightning each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw against your spellcasting DC. If you are not a spellcaster this DC is equal to 8 + your Proficiency + your Constitution modifier. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 Lightning damage and on a successful save, it takes half that much damage.
Additionally, any creature that grapples you or makes a melee attack targeting you while you are channeling this energy takes 1d4 Lightning damage.
