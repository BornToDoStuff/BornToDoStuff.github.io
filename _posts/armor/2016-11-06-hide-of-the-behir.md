This mottled blue armor is covered in cracked carapace. While wearing this armor you have resistance to lightning damage.
Once per long rest as an action you can plant your feet and begin channeling pure elemental energy. For the next minute energy crackles from your head to your feet and as an action you can fire a 1 foot wide 20 foot long line of searing lightning from your mouth.

Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw against your spellcasting DC. If you are not a spellcaster this DC is equal to 8 + your Proficiency + your Constitution modifier. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 lightning damage, on a successful one it takes half that much damage.
Additionally, any creature that grapples you or makes a melee attack against you while you are channeling takes 1 Lightning damage.

Channeling the elements like this requires concentration, and if you lose concentration while channeling you take 4d8 lightning damage. However, you can release the energy and stop channeling as an action without incurring this damage.
