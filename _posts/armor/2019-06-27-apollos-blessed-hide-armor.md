This well-crafted hide armor is a deep red, but does not appear to be dyed by conventional means, and does not have a single blemish or scratch.

### Hand of Apollo
Once per short rest you can cast <magic-spell>Conjure Volley</magic-spell>, <magic-spell>Swift Quiver</magic-spell>, or <magic-spell>Mass Cure Wounds</magic-spell> as an action.Â 

### Averter of Evil
While wearing this armor each day at dawn you can choose one type of creature: aberrations, fey, fiends, or undead. Creatures of this type have disadvantage on attacks rolls against you, and you can not be Charmed, Frightened, or Possessed by your chosen creature type until the next day.
