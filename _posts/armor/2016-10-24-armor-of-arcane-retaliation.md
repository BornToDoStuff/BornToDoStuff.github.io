This armor has a cylinder attached to the back, at the base of the neck, and several tendrils reaching from the cannister to the armorâ€™s reinforced pauldrons.
Once per short rest as a reaction to taking acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you may activate the armor. While the armor is activated you have resistance to the triggering damage type until the end of your next turn. Each time you are hit, including the triggering attack, by the triggering damage type while the armor is active the armor gains one charge. As an action you can expend 1 or more charges to force all creatures with a 10-foot radius, other than you, to make a Dexterity saving throw DC 10 + proficiency, as elemental energy is forcefully discharged from the pauldrons. A creature takes 1d6 damage per charge expended, of the damage type that created the charge(s), on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Any charges still stored in the armor by dawn are harmlessly vented from the cannister.
