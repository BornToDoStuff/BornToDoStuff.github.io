This armor has a reinforced metal cylinder attached at the nape of the neck, and sprouting from it are several tendrils reaching to the armorâ€™s reinforced pauldrons. 
As a reaction to taking acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you may activate the armor and gain one charge. Until the beginning of your next turn you have resistance to the damage type of the triggering attack and gain one additional charge each time you are hit by this damage type.
All unexpended charges are harmlessly vented from the canister each day at dawn.

As an action you may expend up to 10 charges to make all other creatures within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, as energy is violently discharged from the pauldrons. Each creature takes 1d6 Force damage per charge expended on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
