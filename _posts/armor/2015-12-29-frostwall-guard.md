This angular shield is pure white with blue fractals emblazoned along its edges. It is said it was forged from the scales of a white dragon to defend an ancient dwarven city, but has since lost much of its power. 
Once per long rest, as an action, you can hold it aloft and speak its command word, casting <magic-spell>Wall of Ice</magic-spell> without concentration.
Additionally, while attuned with this shield you can sense incoming snow storms, and always know if there is a white dragon within 1 mile of you.
