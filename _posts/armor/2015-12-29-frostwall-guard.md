This pure white kiteshield is emblazoned with blue fractals along its edges. It is said it was forged from the scales of a white dragon to defend an ancient dwarven city, but has since lost much of its power. This shield has 10 charges and regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges each day at dawn. 

As an action, you can hold the shield aloft and speak its command word, expending a number of charges. As you do so an icy blast comes forth from the shield casting <magic-spell>Wall of Ice</magic-spell> and forming a total number of 10-foot-square panels equal to the charges spent.
Additionally, while attuned with this shield you can sense incoming snow storms, and always know if there is a white dragon within 1 mile of you.
