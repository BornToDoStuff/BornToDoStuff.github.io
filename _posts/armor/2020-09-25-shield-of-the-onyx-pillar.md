This tall rectangular shield is lavishly emblazoned with a towering mountain and set with onyx. As a bonus action while standing on stone or earth you may activate the shield to create a 5-foot-square pillar of stone and onyx in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you that rises to a height of 15 feet or until it meets the ceiling. This pillar sinks back down into the earth after 1 minute, or when you create another pillar, leaving the ground undisturbed.
