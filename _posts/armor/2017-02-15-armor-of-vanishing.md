This armor has a plate of silver polished to a mirror finish embedded in the middle of its chest.

While you are wearing this armor if you are struck with a critical hit and it does not knock you unconscious you turn Invisible until the end of your next turn, or until you attack or cast a spell.
Additionally, after each long or short rest while wearing this armor you gain +5 to Dexterity(Stealth) checks and initiative rolls for the next hour or until you make an attack or cast a spell.
