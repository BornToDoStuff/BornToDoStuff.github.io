This chainmail is dull and rusted, and has red links of an unknown metal woven throughout it in no discernable pattern. No amount of scrubbing and polishing can clean off the rust that has accumulated.

While wearing this armor when your speed is reduced to 0 a large dark sigil appears beneath your feet and rusty chains fly up from the ground, encircling you and any creature grappling you if you are grappled. While these chains are tangled around you you have resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by weapon attacks but any other creatures do not gain this benefit. Additionally, any hostile creature that ends their turn within 5 feet of you or any creature besides you that is entangled in the chains takes 1d10 necrotic damage.
Any creature entangled by the chains must make a DC 16 Strength check to escape. These chains return to the ground and the sigil disappears once all creatures trapped within them have escaped or died. The chains also release their targets and return to the ground if exposed to <magic-spell>Aura of Purity</magic-spell>, <magic-spell>Aura of Life</magic-spell>, or <magic-spell>Holy Aura</magic-spell>.

<section id="curse">
**Curse.** When your speed is reduced to 0 you are considered Restrained because of the chains. This condition persists even after the initial effect that caused it ends, unless you succeed on a DC 16 Strength check against the chains. Each time you fail to escape from the chains you take 1d4 necrotic damage. If you are reduced to 0 hp while trapped in the chains they persist for 3 rounds continuing to restrain you. If you are not stabilized by the end of this time you are dragged through the ground and transported to The Abyss.
