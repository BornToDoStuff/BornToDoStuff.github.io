This chainmail is dull and rusted, and has red links of an unknown metal woven throughout it chaotically. No amount of scrubbing and polishing can clean off the rust that has accumulated.

While wearing this armor when your speed is reduced to 0 a dark sigil appears beneath your feet and rusty chains fly up from the ground, encircling you and any creature grappling you. While these chains are wrapped around you you have resistance to all Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. Any hostile creature that in entangled in these chains or ends their turn within 5 feet of these chains takes 1d12 Necrotic damage.

Any creature entangled by the chains, including you, must make a DC 16 Strength check to escape. The chains and sigil disappear once all creatures trapped by them have escaped or died. They also disappear if exposed to <magic-spell>Aura of Purity</magic-spell>, <magic-spell>Aura of Life</magic-spell>, or <magic-spell>Holy Aura</magic-spell>.

<!--excerpt-->
<div class="curse">
**Curse.** Each time you try and fail to escape from the chains you take 1d6 Necrotic damage. If you become unconscious while entangled by the chains the sigil brightly glows for 3 rounds before dragging you through the ground and transporting you to The Abyss unless you are are stabilized or regain consciousness.
