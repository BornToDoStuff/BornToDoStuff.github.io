When unrolled this scroll slowly lofts into the air just above head height and expands to create a 30 foot by 20 foot floating canvas, lengthwise in the direction the caster was looking, casting a lovely patch of shade. It will remain in the location it was opened for the next 10 hours before it sinks to the ground and dissolves into sand.
