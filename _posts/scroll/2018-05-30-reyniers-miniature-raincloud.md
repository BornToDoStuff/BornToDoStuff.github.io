This scroll is sealed with white wax that shimmers in the light and has the crest of a lightning bolt. When the seal is broken a tiny cloud the size of a fist appears 5 feet directly above the scroll. This cloud grows until it is 5 feet wide before beginning to rain. It rains 1d4 gallons of water over the course of 1 minute. This water is perfectly clear and could even be described as glittering. After 1 minute a single lightning bolt strikes the ground from the tiny cloud before it dissipates, and any creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 Lightning damage.
