This scroll unrolls into a single large piece of paper, with one side blank and the other covered in runes. When you put the blank side over an object or paper with writing on it and rub the runes the runes fade, and when turned over the blank side will be a perfect copy of all writing that the scroll was covering, as if it was scribed with black ink.
