When unrolled underwater this scroll quickly re-rolls itself before morphing into to a slender bamboo shoot about 5 feet long. It is hollow, and while very narrow the user will find they can breathe through it perfectly. The scroll will remain in this form for the next hour during which for all intents and purposes it is a length of bamboo. At the end of the hour it will collapse into a soggy sheet of parchment.
