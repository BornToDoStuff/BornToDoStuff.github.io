This scroll appears to be a summoning spell to anyone who is not familiar with this scroll. If this scroll is activated it crumples itself and begins to inflate until it resembles a paper lantern. It then floats at head height an arms length behind the creature that activated it, casting light out to 15 feet.
The scroll remains in this form for the next 8 hours or until it is damaged. When the 8 hours are up or it is damaged it sets alight and burns to ash. If it is put out it continues to dim until the light extinguishes completely and falls to the ground.
