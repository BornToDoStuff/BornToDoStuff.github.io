This scroll has runes all along its outside edge and no way that you can discern to activate it. However, if this scroll is damaged by any melee weapon it will begin burning and the sound of crumpling paper can be heard. At the beginning of your next turn it will suddenly harden into a copy of the weapon that damaged it. This copy lasts 1 hour before it once again bursts into flames and then turns to ash. If the weapon is magical it will not copy any of its magical abilities but will perfectly mimic its appearance and basic properties.
