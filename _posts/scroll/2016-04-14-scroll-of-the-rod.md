When this light gray parchment scroll is rolled tightly and bent over the knee it quickly stiffens as its color shifts to the look of cast iron. Over the next few seconds it elongates to a 4 foot rod that is as straight as an arrow. The rod is about two fingers wide, and feels like parchment but has all the properties of iron. It weighs 4 pounds and can support up to 400 pounds. The scroll will remain in this form for the next hour. At the end of one hour it will shrink down its previous size but will keep its metalic properties.
