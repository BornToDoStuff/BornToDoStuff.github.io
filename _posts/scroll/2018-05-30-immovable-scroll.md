This scroll is flecked with what looks like pieces of metal and springs open as if it wants to be flat instead of rolled up. You can see a clear outline of a hand within its runes. As an action you can unroll this scroll and place your hand in the outline. When you do so it hardens and becomes magically fixed in place. Until the scroll becomes wet or burns it doesnâ€™t move, even if it is defying gravity. It can hold up to 100 pounds of weight. More weight causes the scroll to shatter. If it does not become wet, burn, or shatter, it will remain in place for the next month before becoming mundane parchment.
