This short, dull metallic rod has a note tied around it with string. The note claims that it was crafted to contain the holy light of "the ancient god of some clerics I am pals with. They live on a mountain so you know it's legit" and is signed with Reynier's signature. It is partially hollow on one end and has a button on the other.

This rod contains 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 charges each dawn. When you press the button a 6 inch beam of light flashes from the hollow of the rod out to 30 feet before quickly flickering out. The first creature hit by this beam regains 2d8 hit points as they are bathed in the warm light. If there are hit points left over after the creature has reached maximum hit points or the creature is already at maximum hit points they must make a Constitution saving throw equal to 8 + the remaining hit points. On a failure they are Stunned for 1 turn and are Blinded for the next minute as their eyes and mind are overwhelmed with a burning sensation and pure light. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.
