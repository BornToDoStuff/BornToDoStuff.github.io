This smooth stone staff is covered in frost and topped with an abstract intricate sculpture of ice. This staff never melts or thaws, and at high altitudes snowflakes dance around it’s base. This staff has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dawn. If the temperature is below freezing at dawn it regains all it’s charges.  

While attuned to this staff you do not suffer from the effects of traveling at high altitude, and know the cantrip <magic-spell>Chill Touch</magic-spell> if you did not already know it. Additionally, as an action, you can expend a charge to chill creatures of your choice within 60 feet. A chilled creature feels a stone cold hand on their neck and must succeed a Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 cold damage and be frightened until the beginning of their turn. Creatures that are made of stone or immune to cold damage automatically succeed this saving throw.
If you are not a spellcaster you use Wisdom as your spellcasting modifier for this item’s effects.
