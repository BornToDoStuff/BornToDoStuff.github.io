This wand is made of a sturdy oak and each end is seamlessly reinforced with bronze. It has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 charges each day at dawn.
You may choose to spend a charge to cast Mending with a range of 10 feet. For every additional charge spent to cast Mending the size you may mend increases by 1 foot.
If you double the charges spent you may cast Mending as an action.
