This ancient ash branch has a startling number of eyes carved into its knots and gnarls.  
The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d8+2 expended charges each day at dawn.

While attuned to this staff as an action you can expend a charge to heighten your senses for the next hour. During this time you can not be surprised, and you have a +5 to your passive Wisdom(Perception) and checks.  
Additionally, as a reaction to a creature using a feature or ability that would inflict the condition Frightened you can expend a number of charges to cast <magic-spell>Heroism</magic-spell>, without expending a spell slot, targeting a number of creatures equal to the charges expended. If you are not a spellcaster you use Charisma as your spellcasting modifier for this effect.
