This wand has 7 charges. It regains 1d6+1 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand suddenly turns into a Tiny creature of the DM’s choosing and escapes from your grasp.   
While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges, targeting a creature you can see within 60 feet.   
The target creature must succeed a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) or be transformed into a beast of your choice as per the spell <magic-spell>Polymorph</magic-spell>, though the  chosen beast must be the same size as the target. The transformation lasts until the end of their next turn or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. It spends the duration confused by it’s new form and is considered Stunned.
