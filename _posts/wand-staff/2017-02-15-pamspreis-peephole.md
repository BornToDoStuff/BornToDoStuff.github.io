This wand has a 2 inch glass ball at the end of it that can be used much like a magnifying glass.

As an action you can tap the ball on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, ceiling, or floor) to create a small hole the same diameter as the ball itself up to 6 feet deep. This lasts up to 1 minute or until you make another such hole and creates no instability in a structure around it. When the hole disappears any objects or creatures that may have managed to fit into it are ejected in a space nearest to the surface the hole was created on.
