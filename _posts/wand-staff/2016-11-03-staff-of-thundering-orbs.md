This gnarled wooden staff has a bent branch at its top forming a hoop and contains 4 charges. While holding it you can use an action to expend a number of charges to cause a flurry of clear crystalline orbs to fly from the hoop. The orbs increase in number dramatically for each charge expended and create one 30-foot cone radiating from the staff per charge. Cones created in this way may not overlap. All creatures in the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or half on a successful one as the orbs burst and create a violent concussion.

The staff regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the staffâ€™s last charge roll a 1d20. On a 1, the staff releases a clap of thunder. All creatures within a 30-foot radius must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 thunder damage.
