This mahogany cane is tipped with corkwood and thin red leather covers its gracefully curved handle.

If you attune to this cane it can be used as a spellcasting focus. It contains 6 charges, and recovers 1d6 expended charges at dawn.

As an action you may tap the cane twice on the ground and expend a number of charges up to the maximum remaining charges. You gain Blindsight for 10 minutes for each charge expended in this way. This blindsight applies as long as you are holding the cane, if you are not holding it you do not benefit from its effects.

Alternatively, as an action you can expend 3 charges and draw a 1 foot square in the air. The air shimmers and then a tear in space appears and a deep purple fog rolls out from it. This one-way rift lasts for 1 minute and can not physically be interacted with in any way or moved after it has been created. However, you see things as if you have Truesight while viewing them through this window.
