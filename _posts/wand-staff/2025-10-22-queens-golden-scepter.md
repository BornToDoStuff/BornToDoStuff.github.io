This rod is polished to a mirror sheen and adorned with a small crown.  
You can use this rod as a spellcasting focus, and any spell you cast while doing so has a bright yellow or golden hue.  
While holding this rod when you cast <magic-spell>Command</magic-spell> you may target any number of tiny or smaller 6-legged creatures within range. The targeted 6-legged creatures automatically fail their saving throw.

Additionally, as an action you can choose a 10-foot cube to become a mass of magical honey. This area is difficult terrain and any creature within it must succeed a Constitution saving throw DC 14 or be hindered as if under the effects of the spell <magic-spell>Slow</magic-spell> until they leave the area. This area lasts for 1 minute or until you put down the rod or choose another cube.
