This light oaken staff is stripped of its bark and has gentle grooves winding up and around it. While you are attuned to this staff you can attune to up to three Ioun Stones without using attunement slots. Additionally, while attuned to this staff when you toss an Ioun stone into the air the stone orbits the staff at a distance of 3-12 inches, instead of your head.

If you make a successful melee attack against an Ioun Stone using this staff and you are attuned to less than three Iuon Stones the stone immediately attunes to you instead, otherwise it falls to the ground unattuned.
